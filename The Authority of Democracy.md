# The Authority of Democracy

Thomas Christiano

Democratic decision making can be evaluated from two different perspectives:

- the quality of the outcomes democratic processes produce (the _substantive_ perspective)
- the quality of the democratic procedure used (the _procedural_ perspective)

Some theorists are _monists_ - they think "there is only one dimension of assessment for political decision-making institutions" p2

For pure proceduralists of the monist variety, if a process is genuinely democratic, then it has authority and ought be complied with. (p2)  Their conception of democratic authority is _holistic_ (p3)

Instrumentalist (of the monist variety) by contrast, can treat some types of decisions as authoritative but not others.

Christiano defends a holistic but not monistic account called _evaluative dualism_.

"If the results of democratic decision-making are unjust, we might ask, what reason do we have for going along with the decision?" (p3)

We value political institutions and the democratic process because they advance some (common) good.  "Pure proceduralism is completely false to the practice of democratic citizenship" (p4) But the democratic process also has an intrinsic fairness that is captures in the procedural account.  Both aspects are important

Evaluative dualism is based on the principle of equal advancement of interests:

1. Justice is concerned with the advancement of the interests of persons.
2. Justice strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of persons when they conflict.
3. Equality fairly balances these conflicts - no ones interests are any more important than anyone else's.

Social justice is a _weakly public principle_ because it concerns the claims people can make against each other.  It must be seen to be done, not just be done. (p5)

"Publicity is not itself an independent good or requirement. Indifferent actions that are done publicly do not thereby become just." (p6)

Moral judgements are fallible.  The principle of equality requires that compare our own interests to others which will necessarily be fallible.  

"A person whose judgment about that society is never taken seriously by others is treated in effect like a child or a madman." (p8)  We all have a fundamental interest in being treated with equal moral standing to others.

The reality of disagreement, fallibility and cognitive bias means that no society can fully publicly embody justice.

Institutions must publicly embody the equal advancements of members for all of society.  Democracy is uniquely suited to do this. It is necessary for social justice. (p9)

1. equal advancement of interests provides a just solution to conflict of interests
2. society cannot be divided and equally distributed
3. democracy allows equal distribution of power in leu of (2)
4. therefore democracy promotes equal advancement of interests

Two accounts of legitimate authority obviate the need for democracy:

- the Normal Justification Thesis (see Raz 1995)
- consent theories

Christiano rejects the NJT because it divorces justice from authority. In doing so, it fails to provide sufficient conditions for the authority of the state. (p13) By making authority legitimate irrespective of dissenters beliefs, It fails to respect people who disagree which the public conception of justice requires.

Politics is about resolving disagreement when it is better to all operate by some rules rather than none. (p15) See Gerry Gaus for a similar account social rules.

"an authority that fails to take the points of view of citizens into account runs afoul of powerful considerations of justice even when it acts on the basis of a correct view of what ought to be done." (p15)

"The trouble with consent theory as a theory of political authority is that it fails to come to terms with the moral necessity of the state." (p16)  Justice requires that we are all on the same page.  Authority is necessary to promulgate the rules needed for the realisation of justice.

The complexity of the rules necessary to realise justice are such that they can only come about if we submit to the authority of a public rule maker.  "Without public rules and a common authoritative rule maker, the public realization of equality is impossible." (p17)

In order to have authority based on consent, a system of rules that recognises non-consent would be required.  There would obviously be disagreement about these rules, so some authority would need to decide or adjudicate.  Consent for this scheme would first be required, and the system would be self defeating. (p19)

Christano's proposed solution is:

>  1. If legislative institutions publicly realize justice, then they have legitimate legislative authority over those people within their jurisdiction.
>  
>  1a. So if a democratic assembly publicly realizes justice then it has
>  legitimate legislative authority over those people within its
>  jurisdiction.
>  
>  2. If there is reasonable disagreement on the justice of legislation, then a
>  democratic assembly will publicly realize justice in itself and only in itself. (Reasonable disagreement is disagreement on how to understand equality that remains after reasonable efforts have been made.)
>  
>  *3. (from 1a and 2) Therefore, democratic assemblies have legitimate legislative authority if there is reasonable disagreement on the justice of the legislation at issue.
>  
>  4. If and only if legislative institutions publicly realize justice in themselves, then they have genuine legitimacy, that is, they have a claim-right to rule and they are owed obedience.
>  
>  4a. If legislative institutions realize justice only in their outcomes, then
>  they have a weak legitimacy, that is, citizens do not owe them obedience though they may usually be morally required to obey many of their laws.
>  
>  *5. (from 2 and 4) Therefore, democratic assemblies have genuine legitimacy if there is reasonable disagreement on the justice of the legislation at issue.

"Since, in complex societies individuals’ interests are likely to be qualitatively quite diverse, failing to take account of a particular group’s conception of the common good may well imply ignoring their qualitatively distinctive interests." (p7)

"Theories simply cannot get off the ground if they require agreement on principles themselves as a condition of justice." (p9)

"it is striking how rarely discussions of authority turn to democracy as a possible source of authority for the state." (p12)

"Part of the point of political organization is to make decisions when there are serious disagreements regarding the matters to be decided." (p15)

"The main purpose of the state is to establish justice among persons within a limited jurisdiction." (p16)

"Since, in order to treat others justly, we must be acting on the basis of the same rules, we need an authority for promulgating those rules in a publicly clear way and we must expect individuals to comply with the rules the authority lays down." (p16)

"The state is engaged in an activity that is a morally necessary one in the sense that someone who fails to comply with the state’s publicly promulgated rules is merely violating a duty of justice to his fellow citizens" (p18)

"Though consent seems an appropriate basis for legitimate authority in morally permissible or even admirable associations, it is not the basis of political authority." (p18)

"The complexity of the rules and the variety of realizations of justice make it such that I cannot determine for myself what to do, I must comply with the rules because they are made by the public rule maker." (p17)
