# Three paradoxes of democracy

"Alone among all forms of government, democracy rests on a minimum of coercion and a maximum of consent." p48

## Democracy needs to be effective providing for the people if the people are to support it

"To be stable, democracy must be deemed legitimate by the people; they must view it as the best, the most appropriate form of government for their society." p49

"Democracy will not be valued by the people unless it deals effectively with social and economic problems and achieves a modicum of order and justice." p49

"Herein lies the paradox: Democracy requires consent. Consent requires legitimacy. Legitimacy requires effective performance. But effectiveness may be sacrificed to consent." p50

## Consent vs Effectiveness

Non-consent based governments can be more effective than consent based ones, especially taking a longer term view.

"The consolidation of democracy...requires some kind of pact ... amongst competing political parties...on structural economic reforms....which all parties will support, no matter which one(s) come to power". p50

"This comparative evidence holds two important lessons. The first is that democracies do not, inherently, perform worse economically than dictatorships. Very probably, they do not inherently perform better, either." p53

"The second is that, since consistency, prudence, and pragmatism in policy are so important to economic development, struggling young democracies must give serious thought to how they can form and maintain a broad consensus on economic policy." p53

## Representativeness vs Governability

"Governability requires sufficient concentration and autonomy of power to choose and implement policies with energy and dispatch." p53

## Conflict versus Consensus

"Democracy implies dissent and division, but on a basis of consent and cohesion." p56

"Over time, citizens of a democracy become habituated to its norms and values, gradually internalizing them.~5 The trick, then, is for democracies to survive long enough--and function well enough--for this process to occur." p57

"for democracy cannot endure if massive inequality and exclusion go unchallenged." p57

## Ethnicity

A consistent 'law' of social science is Ethnic cleavages do not die. p58

"There are four principal mechanisms for managing ethnicity politically within a democratic framework: federalism, proportionality in the distribution of resources and power, minority rights (to cultural integrity and protection against discrimination), and sharing or rotation of power, in particular through coalition arrangements at the center." p58

Federal systems disperse conflict by transferring much of it to state and local levels; generate intraethnic conflict, pitting different factions of ethnic groups against one another in the struggle for control of state and local governments; induce interethnic cooperation as states find the need to coalesce with one another; generate crosscutting cleavages if some ethnic groups are split into different states, with different interests, advantages, and needs; reduce disparities by enabling backward and minority peoples to rise within their own state bureaucracies and educational systems" p58"

"This points to another virtual law: the impossibility of stable democracy in a society where ethnic cleavages are deep and power is heavily centralized." p58

"greater and more pervasive the power of the state, the more will parties want to get it and keep it at any price." p59

"A balanced political culture--in which people care about politics, but not too much--is possible only in structural circumstances where people can afford not to care too much," p59
