# The Evolution of Cooperation

Robert Axelrod 1981

Axelrod's question for investigation is "under what conditions will cooperation emerge in a world of egoists without central authority?"
p3

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

A situation where what is best for each person individually leads to mutual defection, whereas everyone would have been better off with mutual cooperation. p9.

	Formally, it occurs when both players face T > R > P S.  (T)emptation to defect, (R)eward for mutual cooperation, (P)unishment for mutual defection, (S)uckers payoff for cooperating with a defector.

Actual payoffs and their symmetry between players don't matter as long as the inequality holds. 

In a finite series of games, the best individual strategy is to defect.  With indefinite iteration however, "no best rule exists independently of the strategy being used by the other player" p14  

Which strategy works best depends on whether the other player's strategy leaves room for cooperation.

"the very possibility of achieving stable mutual cooperation depends upon there being a food change of a continuing interaction, as measured by the magnitude of _w_" p16

The discount factor _w_ of future rewards _R_ is 1/(1-w)

Iterative tournaments show that "cooperation can indeed emerge in a world of egoists without central authority" p20

## Tit for Tat

Tit for Tat (reciprocate immediate) was the most effective strategy. p20 

Its success was a combination of being nice, retaliatory, forgiving and clear. p54

"While it pays to be nice, it also pays to be retaliatory" p46

Tit for Tat is _collectively stable_ meaning no other strategy can invade it if _w_ is sufficiently large. p56

For a cooperative strategy to be stable, it must somehow make it unprofitable for a challenger to exploit it. p62

A world of mean strategies (such as All D) cannot be invaded by a single cooperative strategy, but can if the new strategy arrives in a cluster. p63

"A strategy is _maximally discriminating_ if it will eventually cooperate even if the other has never cooperated yet, and once it cooperates, will never cooperate again with All D but will always cooperate with another player using the same strategy as it". p66

Advantage of cooperative strategies against a mix of others is:

	Rc * p + Rd * p (1 - p)  Rc - discounted reward for cooperation, Rd - discounted reward for defection, p - proportion of cooperative players.

If a nice strategy cannot be invaded by a single meanie, it cannot be invaded by a cluster of meanies. p67

Cooperation can emerge in a world of unconditional defectors provided a cluster of cooperation can get a foothold. p68

For a nice strategy to be collectively stable, it must be provokable. p69

Cooperation is based on reciprocity. p84

## Strategies

"While foresight is note necessary for the evolution of cooperation, it can certainly be helpful." p109

Advice for players in a prisoner's dilemma: p110

- Don't be envious
- Don't be the first to defect
- Reciprocate both cooperation and defection
- Don't be too clever

Interplayer relative comparison as a criterion of success leads to envy and defection. Envy is self destructive. p111

Tit for Tat never performed better than any other strategy in any single game iteration.  It won by encouraging cooperation, rather than attempting to defeat an opponent. p112

Ecological analysis shows that only doing well against strategies that themselves perform poorly is self defeating as the pool of victims quickly diminishes. p117

Tit for Tat doesn't try to destroy or defeat opponents - it thrives on interactions with other nice strategies. p118

The precise level of forgiveness to defection depends on the environment. If recriminations are likely, be generous.  If exploitation is likely, forgiveness is costly. p120

Random strategies appear unresponsive. Unresponsive strategies can't be trained to cooperation. Untrainable strategies encourage others to defect. p122

Cooperation can be promoted by: p126

- Increasing the shadow of the future by making interactions more durable or frequent
- Change the payoffs
- Teach altruism
- Teach reciprocity

"Altruism is a good name to give to the phenomenon of one person's utility being positively affected by another person's welfare" p135

Turning the other check (to defection) encourages defection and externalises policing to other players. p136

"The insistence on no more than equity is a fundamental of many rules based on reciprocity" p137

When there is no central authority responsible for enforcement, players must rely on themselves to provide others with the necessary incentives for cooperation. p138

"A community using strategies based on reciprocity can actually police itself" p138

## Social Structure

Labels, stereotypes and status provide clues as to how others should be dealt with.

Stereotypes can become self fulfilling when they encourage cooperations within groups but not between them, placing any minority groups at a collective disadvantage. p146

"If you become a deviant, you are like to return, sooner or later, to the role expected of you" p148

"The futility of isolated revolt is a consequence of the immutability of the other players [dominant] strategy" p150

The best reputation to have is that of a bully.  p152

The best strategy is to not be a bully, but always refuse to be bullied. p153

"To be effective, a government must elicit compliance from the majority of the governed." 

Trust is not necessary for cooperation. All that is needed is reciprocity and enough expectation of future interaction. p174

"The foundation of cooperation is note really trust, but the durability of the relationship" p179

Central authorities seem necessary when anticipation of future interaction breaks down. p179

The longer violations go unchallenged, the more likely an opponent will view exploitation as profitable. p185
