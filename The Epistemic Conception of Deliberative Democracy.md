# The Epistemic Conception of Deliberative Democracy

Deliberative democracy qualifies as a "family of views according to which public deliberation of free and equal citizens is the core of legitimate political decision making and self-government" (Bohnman 1998 p401)

The epistemic conception counts as one of these views (fair or procedural being the other common type). p27

The thesis then is: p28
  
  1. "a coherent defender of deliberative democracy cannot hold a pure proceduralist conception"
  2. "an adequate epistemic conception of deliberate democracy must combine both dimensions [epistemic & intrinsic] ... to avoid elitist trends."

> Deliberative democracy is a normative ideal of democracy. p28

Deliberative here meaning a collective process of exchaning reasons with the intent of rationally convincing others. p29

The Epistemic Conception means democracy is justified / legitimate because deliberatively democratic procedures have more epistemic value than other _democratic_ and _non democratic_ alternatives. p33

Similar views are held by Cohen, Estlund, Nino, & Gaus.

Importantly, it requires reliability to know which choice is the right political decision in general. This permits outcomes to be simultaneously legitimate but wrong. p33

Ontological Thesis:

> One or several standards of rightness of political decisions exist as something at least partially independent both from the decision making procedure and from the participants' beliefs, preferences, and desires. And this standard is knowable. p34

Epistemic Thesis:

> Democratic deliberation is in general the most reliable democratic procedure in order to identify which are the right political decisions, and therefore it is a the adequate method to make legitimate political decisions. p35

The intrinsic and instrumental justifications are not mutually exclusive. p36  We are not obliged to choice between these two options as they can be combined in diverse ways. p37

Strong reading of the Epistemic Conception: the epistemic value of deliberative democracy stems from the combined value in both deliberation and democracy. p38

Weak reading: the epistemic value of deliberative democracy comes from deliberation only.

The strong reading of DD is committed to something like CJT while the weak reading isn't. p39

Lists the 4 requirements
  - sincere voting (although it can still hold with strategic voting)
  - independent voting
  - only 2 alternatives (Goodin & List show k alternatives)
  - competence of each voter above 0.5

Independence is impossible if no communication is a necessary condition of independence. p40

The main challenge to CJT is how can we know that people have an epistemic average above 0.5 (p41) "The CJT is implacable if this condition is not met".

> The problem here is that it is absolutely impossible to know what anyone's epistemic competence is, unless we have independent access to truth, and this of course is not the case. (Estlund 1993 p93 & 1997 pp185-186) p41

Do we have some reason to presuppose voter competence?

Goodin & Estlun (2004 p136) suggest the principle of charity: "our fellow citizens are more likely to be right than wrong".

Alternatively, flipping a coin gives 50% so any application of reason should help.

Deliberation can increase epistemic value by: (p42-43)

  1. increasing exchange and pooling of information
  2. improves detection of factual and inference mistakes
  3. helps control emotional factors and filter irrational preferences
  4. make manipulation of information and agenda more difficult.
