# When are thought experiments poor ones?

> SUMMARY.  A characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy is its ample use of thought experiments. We formulate two features that can lead one to suspect that a given thought experiment is a poor one. Although these features are especially in evidence within the philosophy of mind, they can, surprisingly enough, also be discerned in some celebrated scientific thought experiments. Yet in the latter case the consequences appear to be less disastrous. We conclude that the use of thought experiments is more successful in science than in philosophy

> There seems to be a world of difference between Galileo’s exemplary argument on the one hand and such a far-fetched story as Searle’s Chinese Room on the other. p 305

> Searle’s argument only takes us further from home

Vairous definitions of thought experiements are provieded by: (p306)

> Thought experiments have been defined as limiting cases of experiments (Sorensen 1992), as arguments (Norton 1991, 1996), as ‘gui- ded contemplations’ (Gendler 1998), as vistas in a Platonic world (Brown 1991), as specific functions in an experiment (Borsboom et al., 2002), or as not arguments at all (Bishop 1999).

> However, this disagreement about what thought experiments are contrasts with the unanimity about what thought experiments should do

> In the view of almost everyone, a thought experiment should give sudden and exhilarating insight. 

> Derek Parfit, has defended their frequent use by stating that thought experiments arouse in us ‘strong beliefs’ (Parfit 1984, 200). (p307)

A replication quality:

> For a thought experiment can only be deemed successful if it induces the same – true or false – belief in the majority of people that are exposed to it. p307

> It is this ‘collectivity’ that does the trick, and a thought experiment that prompts diametrically opposed beliefs is not very successful, to say the least.

The Monty Hall paradox is used as an example - it generates consistently false beliefs!

> The reason why these puzzles are so disturbingly successful is because they arouse in almost all of us the same – false – belief. 


## Bad Thought Experiments 1 - Conlusions contradict one another

> whereas he claims that scientific thought experiments came into being with the aim of evading the contradictory conclusions with which ordinary experiments would often have left us, we claim that thought experiments in contem- porary analytic philosophy often generate contradictory conclusions. p308

This is problematic not just in ethics but also Phil or Mind (see conflicting intuitions about Zombies and Qualia)


## Bad Thought Experiments 1 - Conlusions beg the question

> It is that the conclusions drawn from thought experiments beg the question: they hinge on intuitions of which the truth or falsity was supposed to be demonstrated by those very thought experiments. p310

Example of Searle's chinese room arguing against strong AI and the leap from syntax to semantics:

> they reiterate those intuitions about ‘understanding’ and ‘knowing what a symbol means’ that were meant to be adjudicated by the very thought experiment in question.

These problems plauge thought experiments in science as well but science has empiric data to fall back upon.
