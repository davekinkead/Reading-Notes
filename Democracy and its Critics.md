# Democracy and its Critics

RA Dahl 1989

  1. The Problem of Inclusion: What persons have a rightful claim to be included in the demos?
  2. The scope of its authority: What rightful limis are there on the control of a demos? Is alienation ever morally permissable?

" The question of inclusion would present a less serious challenge if a demos could enact rules that were only binding on itself." p119  The problem isn't as serious for voluntary associations.

One response is to rely on _contingent citizenship_ - the accidents of history.  This however lacks normative force but it's strongest propoent was Schumpter - the rule of the Soviet Union by the Bolshevik party doesn't make it undemocratic unless the party is rulled undemocratically. This is "truely no solution at all" p121

We can then distunguish: p122

  - a system is democratic in relation to its own demos
  - a system is democratic in relation to everyone subject to its rule

Citizenship can also be viewed as a _categorical right_.

> All those subject to a democracy's rule have a right to participate

Classical and modern scholars such as Mill, Rouseau, and Locke prioritised the contingent over categorical claims. p126

"The Problem of the Unit"

> To the extent that the unit within which majority rule operates is unjustifiable, then majority rule is unjustifiable in that unit. p193

The problem of the unit breaks down into multiple questions

  - what types of associations should be goverened democratically? The states, corporations, the family?
  - what types of associations should be sovereign? Cities, regions, nations?
  - what level of association should matters be decided? Who decides this?

Dahl charaterises this as two issues: p195

  - scope of control: claims with respect to certain matters, narrow jurisdiction to total soveriegnty
  - domain of persons: which group does the deciding, local area to transnational 

Non-Solutions (p196)

  - peoples define themselves. No substantive grounds for deciding between counter claims
  - political autonomy as an absolute right. Dahl claims this degenerates into anarchism

  > The criteria of the democratic process presuppose the rightfulness of the unit itself (p207)

  Dahl proposes the following criteria for inclusion: (p207-209)

    1. The domain and scope can be clearly identified

    2. The people in the domain strongly desire autonomy

    3. The people in the domain desire democratic self-government

    4. The scope is within justifiable limits

    5. The people within the domain currently have little control over the scope

    6. Consensus within the domain is higher than alternative units

    7. Gains must outway costs
