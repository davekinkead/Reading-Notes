#The Boundary Problem in Democratic Theory

**Sarah Song 2012 International Theory**

## Argument

1.	Affected Interest (AI) & Subject to Coercion (SC) view democracy as overly procedural
2.	Democracy also includes ideals like political equality and solidarity
3.	AI & SC undermine those ideals
4.	AI & SC are not suitable basis for bounding the demos.

Typical accounts that legitimate the people include:

- nationalism (see Walzer 1985)
- history (see Nasstrom 2007)
- affected interests (see Shapiro 1999, Young 2000, Gould 2004, Goodin 2007)
- subject to coercion (see Lopez-Guerra 2005, Abizadeh 2008)

Defining the demos as the state is both over and under inclusive. Over, because many not affected are given a say & under because resident aliens are not. p40

Normative core of democracy includes ideals as well as processes. AI & SC accounts treat democracy as procedural. p41

Political equality & solidarity are normative cores of democracy that are adversely affected by the AI & SC.

"The fundamental moral presumption of democracy is that no person is intrinsically superior to another" p43

"Democracy is a collective decision making process subject to the condition of equality" p43

	- but is the equality required amongst all those subject to law or merely those who make the law?
	- does this require equality between ruler and subject?

Political equality requires protecting equal rights and liberties and ensuring equal opportunities for political influence.

The ideal deliberative procedure seeks to filter nonpublic claims from claims orientated to the common good. p44

Deliberative accounts are based on the exchange of reasons acceptable to others with different views and require the protection of nonpolitical rights as a constitutive element of democracy. p45
