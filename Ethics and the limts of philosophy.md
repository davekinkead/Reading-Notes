# Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy

*Bernard Williams*

## ยง6 - Theory and Prejudice

Ethical theories start with the notion of beliefs. p93

Beliefs that are spontaneous convictions, are _intuitions_. p94

So while intuitions seem incapable of grounding an ethical theory (because of so many opposing intuitions), they are the subject of ethical theory. p94

The aim of an ethical theory is to resolve conflicting intuitions but how can it do this? p99
