# What is Philosophical Methodology?

## Joshn Dever

"Philosophical Methodology is the study of philosophical method: how to do philosophy well." p22

> This article tackles the metamethodological question of what kind of thing a philosophical methodology (good or not) is or would be, and what kind of questions would count as methodological questions. The primary focus is on a ‘higher-order’ reading, on which admissible answers are the epistemological methods that distinguish philosophy from the natural sciences (on one side) and the humanities (on the other side) or the pursuit of a description of reality at the most fundamental level. The article uses ‘Philosophical Methodology’ to pick out questions of the higher order, and ‘philosophical methodology’ to pick out questions of the lower order. To provide a robust data pool, it takes all occurrences of the word “methodological” in entries of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and considers what plausible theories of Philosophical Methodology can be fitted onto the bed of that range of usage. It also discussses seven hypotheses that account for the nature of Philosophical Methodology: Eliminativism, Working-Hypothesism, Epistemologism, Theory Selectionism, Necessary Preconditionalism, Hierarchicalism, and Eliminatedivism. 

> The question “What is philosophical methodology?” admits of a ‘lower-order’ reading, on which admissible answers are the use of thought experiments to test conceptual analyses or understanding us and our environments in a way conducive to human flourishing. But the same question admits of a ‘higher-order’ reading, on which admissible answers are the epistemological methods that distinguish philosophy from the natural sciences (on one side) and the humanities (on the other side) or the pursuit of a description of reality at the most fundamental level. p1-2

> I think even this small sample of the usage suffices to show that there’s no obvious and straightforward fitting of an account of Philosophical Methodology onto the way in which philosophers use “methodological” talk. p6

Eliminativism: The idea that we don't lose anything from dropping the term 'methodological'.  Dever suggests that while accepting eliminativism would require an error theory for philosophers using the term ...

> What does emerge from the consideration of eliminativism is that, while there is surely a robust and substantive notion of Philosophical Methodology embedded in our practice, it also looks undeniable that philosophical rhetoric has an inclination toward “methodological creep” – there is a temptation to achieve gravitas by calling points methodological. p8

Working Hypothesis: The idea that a principle can be characterised as methodological "on the grounds that guiding theorizing by it produces better final theories" p9

> Philosophical Methodology is, on this conception, the task of identifying “working  hypotheses”, tentative assumptions, and norms of investigation that lead to good  theorizing. p8

The worry though is that:

> There is no clear stopping point on the  spectrum from “assume until forced to do otherwise that biological phenomena  have reductive biochemical explanations” to “try to make your semantic theories  compositional, unless that gets hopelessly messy” to “consider a wide range of  logical options”, to “don’t do philosophy while drunk”. p9

Epistemologism: "the assumption that what we are trying to do when we do philosophy is to come  to know various (philosophical) truths about the world" p10

> Epistemologism about Philosophical Methodology encompasses much of the recent  work that goes under the specific banner of “philosophical methodology”. p10

> We need to know what kind of philosophical thesis  can be tested by thought experiments (only necessary theses?), what kinds of things  thought experiments are (for example, what the content of a thought experiment is),  whether thought experiments are a global epistemic device across philosophy or  whether their application is limited to specific subdomains of philosophy, whether  the reactions of all subjects to thought experiments are equally valid or whether  successful/epistemicallyEweighty evaluation of a thought experiment requires  specific skills or expertise, whether evaluation of a thought experiment is  underwritten by specific epistemic faculties such as intuition or a generic capacity  for the evaluation of counterfactuals, and so on.  p11

"the descriptive issues in Epistemologist Philosophical Methodology  tend to blend seamlessly into general epistemological questions ... [s]ince many of the propositions we want to  assess in philosophy appear to be either a priori true or a priori false" p11

The worry is that there is no difference between philosophical methodology becomes indistinguishable  from epistemology in general.

> it is an open question whether there is anything distinctively  philosophical in philosophical methodology, taken in this epistemological sense. p12

> Actual  philosophical practice involves pretty much every imaginable epistemic method:  arguments deductive and inductive, experimentation, opinion survey, reflective  equilibrium, critical selfEexamination, phenomenological introspection, textual  exigesis and eisigesis, and so on. p12

> If there is nothing distinctively philosophical in  philosophical methodology, and philosophical methodology is just the epistemology  of philosophical practice, then philosophical methodology collapses into  epistemology.  p12

Theory Selectionism: "X is a methodological axiom or principle if X is a consideration which  favors selecting one theory over another" p14

> Philosophical Methodology is on this picture metaphilosophy in the sense that it is  an attempt to characterize what we are trying to do when we do philosophy, rather  that a firstEorder attempt to do philosophy. p15

Necessary Preconditionalism: "assuming that proposition is a necessary precondition to carrying out  theorizing of some form" p16

>  there is realization that  conventions are a necessary precondition to scientific theorizing, because  conventions are needed to mediate between theory and observation in order to  have an account of theory confirmation and disconfirmation. p17

The concern however is that "Necessary Preconditionalism seems to require a strong essentialism about  philosophical enterprises. " p17

Hierarchicalism: "there are  chains of dependency relations between different areas of philosophy, and  “methodological” considerations are considerations that require retreat from area A  up a stage in the hierarchy to area B on which area A depends. " p19

> Hierarchicalism validates what I take to be a common sense that methodological  concerns are in some way “philosophically deep”, because in raising methodological  concerns we are (according to Hierarchicalism) moving up the dependency ladder.  Unfortunately, the background assumption that there is a suitable partial ordering  of the fields of philosophy looks to be wholly without plausibility. p19

Eliminatedivism: 

> There’s no hierarchy here. We move from philosophy of language to philosophy of  logic to metaphysics, but then from metaphysics back to philosophy of language. So  there is movement from one area of philosophy to another, and movement that is, in  some important sense, methodologically driven. But the movement isn’t the tracing  of a preEgiven hierarchical structuring of the field. It is rather, as in the example of  The Puzzle, part of the ongoing attempt to do better work, and achieve more and  deeper insights, by thinking about how various components of the field relate to one  another, rather than allowing one’s work to reside entirely in one subdiscipline of  philosophy.  p21

> There is such a thing as Philosophical Methodology –  it’s the study of the rules of good philosophical practice. But there are no rules of  good philosophical practice. p21
