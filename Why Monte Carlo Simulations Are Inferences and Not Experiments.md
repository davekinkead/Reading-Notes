# Why Monte Carlo Simulations Are Inferences and Not Experiments

### Claus Beisbart and John D. Norton (2012)

"we hold that simulations are merely arguments, albeit quite elaborate ones, and their results are recovered fully by inferences from the assumptions presumed." p403

In experiments, outcomes are only learned by doing, not inferring. Simulations are often complex like experiments but "as far as their epistemic access to the world is concerned, Monte Carlo simulations are merely elaborate arguments." p 404

"First, indirectly, Monte Carlo simulations could not be anything else. In particular, they do not gain knowledge of parts of the world by interacting with them, as do ordinary experiments. They can only return knowledge of the world external to them in so far as that knowledge is introduced in the presumptions used to set up the simulation. They exploit that knowledge to yield their results by an inferentially reliable procedure, that is, by one that preserves truth or the probability of truth. Second, directly, an inspection of Monte Carlo simulations shows them merely to be a sequence of inferences no different from an ordinary derivation, with the addition of some complications. These are: there are very many more individual inferences than in derivations normally carried out by humans with pencil and paper; the choice of which inferences to make is directed by a randomizer; and there are meta- level arguments that the results are those sought in spite of the random elements and approximations used." p403

Knowledge can be informed by _discovery_ or _inference_.  Discoveries are self sufficient, inferences are not - they do not rely on contact with the external world. 

 "Thought experiments, Norton (1996, 2004) maintains, operate in this way. They are merely picturesque arguments that make inferences from presumptions implicit in the description of the thought experiment scenario." p409
