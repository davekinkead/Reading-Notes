# Simulation and Similarity

Contemporary science employs: (p7)

 - concrete models
 - mathematical models (abstract structures)
 - computational models (sets of procedures)

"all three models consist of an _interpreted structure_ that can be used to represent a real or imagined phenomenon. ... These interpretations tell us what the model is about and set up the relations of denotation between models and their intended targets." (p15)

Organic models are useful when we want to study organisms in general rather than particular organisms. (p16). They are concrete models.

Verbal/Narrative models (see Winther 2006) can be any type.

Weisberg's focus is on the epistemic questions of how many types of models do we need to develop an account of modelling in science.

The difference between computational and mathematic models (according to Weisberg) is in the location of explainatory power.  For the computational model, it is in the algorithm, for the mathematical, it is in the relationship of variables. (p20)

See Martin Thomson‚ÄêJones (2006). Models are just sets of propositions - semantic content that represents targets or problem domains.
