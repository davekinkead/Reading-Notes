# Hobbes and the Social Contract Tradition

Hobbes thought that

> we are creatures who can live in peace only if we subject ourselves to an absolute soverign p5

> natural and political philosophy can be separated (de Corp)

The individual is conceptuall prior to society p6. See Gauthier 1977 p138

> man is social because he is human, not human because he is social.

His methodolgy is to resolve a system into its constituent pieces, analyse them, and reconstitue them via a theory that explains their interactions. p7  See De Cive prefernce

When Hobbes disects and analyses society in its parts, he expects to find other wholes - ie man.  This then is the _state of nature_ - men isolated from their social system. p7

> In his view, when we theoretically sunder society and put men into this natural state, human individuals are not destroyed when they are stripped of their social connections; they are best revealed by that sundering. p7

Humans are radically individual. Our desires and capacities are instrinsic properties and thus present in the state of nature. Society has only instrumental value.  p9


Humans are equal - roughly similar in terms of size and strength. p24

Hobbes "refuses to recognise any qualitative or significant quantitative differences in ability, either mental or physical, among people" p24  The weakest can kill the strongest, the dumbest can become the cleaverest



> Hobbes' and Locke's point is that because no one is superior mentally or physically as to be able to establish rulership quickly and securerly over everyone else _without_ their cooperation, we must be treated from a political stand point as equal to one another - which means we are naturall subordinate to no one. p26

Social contract theory views political subbordination as something _unnatural_.

Social heirachy is social, not natural. Hobbes rejects the notion of nobility but accepts absolute monarchy (via consent). p27

The two justifications for conflict in nature - the rational account and passions account - are inconsistent with one another. p54

## The rational account (Lev Ch 11 & 13)

Competition.

  1. Humans have certain perpetual needs - food, security, companionship.  Hobbes calls the pursuit of means the persuit of power.
  3. Each man has a _natural right_ to pursue those means.
  4. The pursuit of indefinitely many things in a finite world leads to conflict as people desire the same things.
  5. Because of natural equality, no one claim is superior.
  6. This leads to competition. "maketh men invade for grain" (Lev Ch 13)

Fear

  1. There is competition for scarce resrouces.
  2. The realisation of this breeds "diffidence" - distrust.
  3. The only way to maintain power is through the aquisition of more power.
  4. Man therefore seeks to become the preminent power to secure his desires from others.

Glory

  1. Men desire respect from others
  2. Being the more powerful garners respect
  3. Man seeks to be the most powerful

On rights...

  The right to self-preservation + the right to choose what is necessary for survival = the right to all things.



> Hobbes says it is rational to keep covenants _in the state of nature_ if one party has already performed. p64

Survival in the state of nature requires confederates. Those who break contracts loose confederates, therefore it is rational to keep contracts.

The rational account leads to a prisoners dilemma while the passions account leads to an assurance game.


Hobbes overall argument

- in the state of nature it is irrational to follow natural law for peaceful cooperation
- there can be no peace without an absolute sovereign
- it is rational to institute an absolute sovereign


  1. Because no commonly interpreted and accepted body of moral laws exists or can be established through agreement or cooperative practice, then no set of laws can be final...because they require a human interpretation.
  2. It is evident that there are individuals or groups who have the right to decide issues and enforce decision.
  3. An infinite regress of such decisions and enforcements is impossible.
  4. Therefore there must exist in civil society, some power who is absolute.
  5. This person or group is the sovereign.


An important theorem:

> Because human beings are unable to establish any substantial cooperation among themselves, and, in particular, are unable to agree on any rules of private property, no law or set of laws can be the final decider in a political regime. p99

Def:

> An _absolute sovereign_ is a person or group who (1) has the power to decide, in the last analysis, all questions in the commonwealth and (2) because of having this power ... has the power to decide whether or not the sovereign should remain in power. p104
