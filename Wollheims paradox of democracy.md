# Wollheim's paradox of democracy

Wollheim's paradox occurs when adherents to democracy hold two incompatible views, namely that A over B ought be done, that the democratic process ought be followed, even when it chooses B over A.

Ewin's solution is to recognise that the voter V, preferring A over B, and then accepting B after some democratic process, is really supporting two different assertions:
- that V prefers A to B
- that V prefers democracy over his own preferences.
