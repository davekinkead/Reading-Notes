> Some of the partisans assert that all philosophical questions are questions about the use of ordinary language, or that all philosophical questions are solved or are about to be solved by considering ordinary linguistic usage. p167

> The edges of 'ordinary' are blurred, but usually we are in no doubt whether a diction does or does not belong to ordinary parlance. p168

Ordinary can mean common but also standard or stock.  We can talk about common & standard, common & non-standard, uncommon but standard, or uncommon and non-standard use of words.

>  We are not contradicting ourselves if we say that he was examining the ordinary use of an unordinary expression. p170

> Doubtless, finally, some of the cardinal problems of philosophy are set by the existence of logical tangles not in this as opposed to that branch of specialist theory, but in the thought and the dis- course of everyone, specialists and non-specialists alike. p170
