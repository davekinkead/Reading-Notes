# Why Hobbes’ State of Nature is Best Modeled by an Assurance Game

A paper to reconstruct Hobbes using game theory, not to critique him.

> Modern social philosophy has been strongly influenced by the prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game. p297

> The dilemma from the perspective of social philosophy is that it is never rational to cooperate in a (one-shot) PD game. Instead, defection is the strictly dominant strategy. p297

> I argue that if one closely follows Hobbes’ line of reasoning in Leviathan, in particular his distinction between the second and the third law of nature, and the logic of his contractarian theory, then Hobbes’ state of nature is best translated into the language of game theory by an assurance game. p298

> The one- shot PD game can model the interaction of Fooles, who misconstrue the game in the state of nature due to their short-sightedness. The assurance dilemma game can model the interaction of Fooles with prudent individuals. p298

> According to Hobbes, the sovereign must exclude free riders from the cooperative framework, or even take their lives, if they are detected. p299

> My aim is only to translate Hobbes’ state of nature argument, as closely as possible, into the language of standard game theory. p303

Moehler is modelling how men behave in the state of nature and infering what actions the Leviathan must take.

> In game-theoretic terms, the sovereign is assumed to play a grim strategy with the citizens once society is established. p299

Tacitly admits that an iterated PD can solve the problem of the state of nature.

>  Therefore, if we take Hobbes’ state of nature argument seriously, which I do in this article, and we do not try to prove him wrong, then the problem of collective action that arises in Hobbes’ state of nature cannot be adequately modeled by an infinitely repeated PD game.

 - @moehler2009 for example, attempts to model the interactions of irrational agents, Hobbes' _Fooles_, with a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma but then model the interations of rational prudent agents with fooles as an Assurance Dilemma.
