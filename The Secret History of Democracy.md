# The Secret History of Democracy

The Secret History of Democracy. Eds. Benjamin Isakhan and Stephen Stockwell. Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. Palgrave Connect. Palgrave Macmillan.

## Introduction: Democracy and History

The history of democracy has been largely told through an inaccurate western lense that typically claims.

- Athenian Democracy --> Roman Republic --> Magna Carte & Renaissance Europe --> 18th century Revolution --> 20th century expansion
- "The Western cast of the standard history suggests that only the West knows democracy and that only the West can bring democ- racy to the rest of the world." p9

The Western centric narrative is problematic for a number of reasons. It is factually incorrect and it biases our understanding of the application of democracy to non-western cultures.

- "Our contention here is that it is neither democracy itself nor the cultural contexts in which it is practised that are the problem, but the limited and limiting narrative which underpins our very narrow understanding of what democracy is and from whence it comes." p9
