# Deliberative Rationality and Models of Democratic Legitimacy

## Seyla Benhabib

Seyla's project is to examine the philosophical foundations of democratic legitimacy.  She argues that "legitimacy in democratic societies must be thought to result from the free and unconstrained public deliberation of all matters about public concern." [p26]

Modern democracies face the task of securing [p26]

  - legitimacy
  - economic welfare
  - viable sense of collective identity

The objects often come into conflict.  In a well functioning democracy, they are in some form of equilibrium.

Democratic legitimacy is defined as:

> ... the belief on the part of the citizens that the major institutions of a society and the decisions reached by the on behalf of the public are worthy of being obeyed. [p27]

So democracy becomes the:

> ... outcome of a procedure of free and reasoned deliberation among individuals considered as moral and political equals. [p27]

Collective identity and economic welfare cannot be the normative basis of democracy.  Legitimacy is critical. 

The task of a philosophical theory of democracy is to articute a form of practical reason represented by democratic rule. 


The discourse model of ethics and politics: 

> ... only those norms ... which would be agreed to by all those affected by their consequences ... reached ... [under] a process of deliberation ... [which had] a) ... equality and symmetry; b) ... the right to question the assigned topis of conversation; c) ... the right to initiate reflexive arguments about the very rules of the discourse procedure ... [p31]

!! This sounds like an account of informed consent, not discourse.  Agreement is essential. And by challenging the system itself, it is self-effacing.

> The discourse model of ethics and politics formulates the most _general principles_ and _moral intutions_ behind the validity claims of a deliberative model of democracy. [p31]
