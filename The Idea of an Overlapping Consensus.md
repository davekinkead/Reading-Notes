# The Idea of an Overlapping Consensus

**John Rawls, 1987**

Rawls is looking for a way to ensure the stability of free democratic societies.  

One of the most important aims of political philosophy is "presenting a political conception of justice that can not only provide a shared public bask for the justification of political and social institutions but also helps ensure stability from one generation to the next." p1

But this social agreement can't be a "a mere modus vivendi, dependent on a fortuitous conjunction of contingencies." p1 It needs to be a "regulative political conception of justice that can articulate and order in a principled way the political ideals and values of a democratic regime, thereby specifying the aims the constitution is to achieve and the limits it must respect"

A "stable social unity secured by an overlapping consensus on a reasonable political conception of justice" p2

An overlapping consensus would be affirmed by opposing religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines, the pluralism of which would increase under the freedoms of democracy. p1

"We are the beneficiaries of three centuries of democratic thought and developing constitutional practice" p2

## Definitions

A political conception of justice is a "moral conception worked out for a specific kind of subject, namely, for political, social and economic institutions" ....and framed solely for that basic structure. p3

It is not a comprehensive conception applied to politics but rather involves no prior commitment to any wider doctrine. p4

## Rawls' Argument

"historical and social conditions of a modern democratic society require us to regard a conception of justice for its political institutions in a certain way" p2  The nature of democracy limits how we can conceive justice (ie no tyrannical imposition of values)

"no general and comprehensive view can provide a publicly acceptable basis for a political conception of justice" p4

The diversity & pluralism of doctrines is a permanent feature and will increase among "political and social conditions secured by the basic rights and liberties historically associated with (democratic) regimes" p4

"the point of the idea of an overlapping consensus on a political conception is to show how, despite a diversity of doctrines, convergence on a political conception of justice may be achieved and social unity sustained in long-run equilibrium, that is, over time from one generation to the next." p5

A conception that all doctrines can recognise as just is a sufficient basis of political justice - "the public role of a mutually recognized political conception of justice is to specify a point of view from which all citizens can examine before one another whether or not their political institutions are just" p6

Quotes

"While I believe that in fact any workable conception of political justice for a democratic regime must indeed be in an appropriate sense liberal—I come back to this question later—its liberalism will not be the liberalism of Kant or of J. S. Mill" p5
