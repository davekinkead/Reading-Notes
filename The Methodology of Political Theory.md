Political theory (the normative type) is a sub-field of political philosophy and political science that addresses the evaluative and normative aspects of politics and society. p1

There are multiple approaches to PT - continental PT including hermeneutics, post-structuralism, post-modernism, strausianism etc but this entry is concerned with analytical approaches.

"Contemporary analytical political theory goes well beyond conceptual analysis" p1

The development of _normative_ theories has been one of its major concerns since the 1970's. p2

PT addresses the conceptual, normative, and evaluative aspects of political science. p2

There is a only a lose demarkation of political and moral philosophy, legal philosophy, social ontology, and normative economics.  "The hallmark of political theory is its mode of theorizing" p3

"The main difference between polticial theory and social choice and welfare theory is not a substantive one...but a methodological one" p5

Conceptual analysis plays an important role in PT as we need to be clear about the concepts we are dealing with. p6 -- see Oppenheim 1981

"any concept has a _domain of application_." p7

"any _classically well-behaved_ concept has _defining conditions_." p7

"a concept's _extension_ is the subset of the domain consisting of precisely those objects that fall under the concept." p7

For any salient concept in PT, there is debate about the appropriate domain of application. p7  As a consequence, we may end up with different extensions of the concept. p8  -- This is where formalisation in code can help - it requires us to make our assumptions explicit.

Rawls & Hart distinguish concepts from conceptions.  Concepts here are less fully specified than conceptions. p8

Desiderata on concepts.  They should:

  - respect our intuitions p8
  - play the right normative, evaluative, or descriptive role p9
  - stand in the right relations to other concepts p9
  - have defining conditions that are neither too thin or too thick p9
  - have defining conditions that are epistemically accessible p10

"Concepts should not be confused with principles of theories" p10

> A principle is a statement - a proposition expressed in language - that applies, at least potentially, to more that one case.  Usually, this is marked by the occurrence of expressions with appropriate quantifiers, such as "for all X, subject to certain conditions, Y is the case". p11

Principles can be evaluative, normative, or descriptive. p11

"The _propositional content_ of a principle is the set of all its implications" p12

> We define a _theory_ as a set of statements - propositions expressed in language - which is a candidate for playing some theoretical or practical role and which is, ideally, representable as the set of all implications of some underlying principle. The set of principles from which the theory can be derived - if there is such as set - is called the theory formulation. p12

-- see Quine 1975 for the syntactic vs semantic approach to defining theories.

We need to distinguish between a theory and support of that theory. We might agree with one but not the other. p13

Theories & principles can be justified internally or externally according the following criteria:

  - (logical) consistency: the set of statements for the theory should be capable of being simultaneously true. p14
  - deductive closure: any statement that is entailed by the theory must also belong to it p15
  - axiomatizability: can it be represented as the set of all implications of some underlying principles. p15 "A good theory illuminates its subject matter by giving us a manageable set of of principles ... that encodes the theory's entire set of propositional content." p15  
  - parsimony: A good theory should avoid unnecessary complexity.  To be illuminating, a theory needs to be simpler than the target phenomenon it seeks to explain. p16

The external validity of a theory can be judged by how well it represents the thing it is about.  For normative and evaluative claims, this might be judged by:

  - taking intuitive judgements as strict evidence p17
  - reflective equilibrium p17
  - thought experiments p18
  - relevant judgements p18
  - the applied moral-philosophy method p19

A theory is abstract on an issue if it is silent on that issue. p19

A theory is idealised on an issue if it entails some falsehood about that issue. p20

Idealisation can occur at: p20

  - the theory itself
  - the conditions of application of the theory's prescriptions
  - the justification of the theory
