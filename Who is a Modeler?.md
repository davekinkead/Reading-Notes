# Who is a Modeler?

## Michael Weisberg 

Thesis: Modeling is different from Abstract Direct Representation.

> I argue that modeling can be distinguished from other forms of theorizing by the procedures modelers use to represent and to study real-world phenomena: indirect representation and analysis. This differentiation between modelers and non-modelers is one component of the larger project of understanding the practice of modeling, its distinctive features, and the strategies of abstraction and idealization it employs. p207

> When faced with such complexity, theorists can employ one of several strategies: They can try to include as much complexity as possible in their theoretical representations. They can make strategic decisions about which aspects of a phenomenon can be legitimately excluded from a representation. Or they can model, studying a complex phenomenon in the real world by first constructing and then studying a model of the phenomenon.  p208

> Characterizing modeling as a distinct kind of theorizing is the main subject of this paper. p208

> I contend that there are important distinctions to be made among the different strategies of theorizing. One of these strategies involves modeling, but there is at least one other as well: what I will call abstract direct representation (ADR). p209

> Beginning with the writings of Patrick Suppes and colleagues, philosophers committed to the semantic view have reconstructed physical, psychological, and biological theories as sets of models, rather than as sets of axiomatic sentences (Suppe [1977]; Domotor [2001]). p209

Modeling has been viewed as: p209

  - simply logician’s set-theoretic models (Suppes [1960])
  - sets of trajectories through a state-space (van Fraassen [1991]; Lloyd [1994]) 
  - systems that would be concrete if they were real (Giere [1988])

Definition:

> Models are abstract structures or physical structures that can potentially represent real-world phenomena. p216

> Modeling, I will argue, is the indirect theoretical investigation of a real world phenomenon using the model. p209

> This happens in three stages. In the first stage, a theorist constructs a model. In the second, she analyzes, refines, and further articulates the properties and dynamics of the model. Finally, in the third stage, she assesses the relationship between the model and the world if such an assessment is appropriate. If the model is sufficiently similar to the world, then the analysis of the model is also, indirectly, an analysis of the properties of the real world phenomenon. Hence modeling involves indirect representation and analysis of real world phenomena via the mediation of models. p209

Modeler's do "not arrive at these model populations by abstracting away properties of real fish, [but by] constructed these model populations by stipulating certain properties." p210

On the non-intuitive results:

> This is not something that Volterra or anyone else would have expected a priori. However, armed with the dynamics of the model, he believed that he had a solution to this perplexing problem. p211

> Volterra’s work on population dynamics was one of the earliest applications of the modeling strategy in population biology and since then, modeling has been employed by nearly every population biologist involved in theorizing. p212

The periodic table is a theory, not mere classification system, because it can be successfully used for prediction. p213

> Although Mendeleev is a theorist, his methods and style of theorizing were quite distinct from Volterra’s. Mendeleev examined elemental properties, worked out which properties were essential and which ones could be abstracted away, and then constructed a representational system that elucidated important patterns and structure among the elements. This scientific activity constitutes theory construction, but not modelling. p215

> My claim here is that Mendeleev did not construct a model and analyze it. He worked directly with abstractions from data, focusing on the key factors that account for chemical behavior. According to some accounts of models, the Periodic Table itself might be considered a model. Even if that is true, it is irrelevant to my thesis because Mendeleev’s intention was to represent trends in real chemical reactivity, not trends in a model system. These issues will be discussed in greater detail in Section 4. footnote 4 p215

> Volterra’s achievement was quite different. He engaged in indirect representation and analysis of predator-prey phenomena via the construction and analysis of a model. His equations described mathematical models of biological populations and these models were similar in certain respects to real biological systems, but the equations were not direct representations of any real system.  p216

Modeling vs Non-Modeling

  - stipulative vs abstracted
  - indirect vs direct

> Many different things can serve as models including physically constructed scale models, model organisms, and mathematical objects p216-217

> When employing mathematical models, one studies the model by studying representations of the models, which I call model descriptions. (equations or computer programs) p217

> Rather than characterize the relationship between models and their descriptions as one of definition, let us characterize the relationship between the description and the model as one of specification p217
