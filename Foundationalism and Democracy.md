Foundationalism and Democracy
=============================

Benjamin Barber 1996

Foundationalist approaches to democracy tend to construct it around natural liberties and absolute rights. p348

If democracy is concerned with a form of knowledge, then it must have foundations in truths that are antecedent to it. p348

But democracy is not a cognitive system about what we can know, but rather a system of conduct to determine what we can will and do. p348

"Where ever there is truth or certain knowledge there need be no politics" p349
