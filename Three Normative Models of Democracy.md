Three Normative Models of Democracy
===================================

JÃ¼rgen Habermas

Habermas critiques two normative models of democracy: the liberal and the republican; before proposing a third: discourse theoretical.

The 2 received views of democracy can be contrasted as:

- Liberal
	- role of democracy is to program government for the benefit of society
	- government is the apparatus of public administration
	- society is a market structured network of individuals
	- politics is the process of pushing private against government interests
	- status of citizens determined primarily via negative rights
	- political rights are the means of asserting private rights in the political sphere
	- the state ought protect equal political rights
	- political rights rest on something higher like reason
	- politics is a contest about questions of preferences
	- a contest for power determined by rational choice of optimal strategies
	- democracy is compromises amongst competing private interests
	- democratic will formation legitimates the exercise of political power

- Republican
	- politics is a reflective form of ethical life
	- a social identity arises from political participation
	- political rights are positive liberties that guarantee participation in the praxis
	- the state ought guarantee political participation which then creates shared social understanding.
	- political rights are the determination of the prevailing politics will
	- politics is a contest about questions of values
	- democracy as an ethical-political discourse, the self-determination of deliberative citizens
	- democratic will formation constitutes society as a political community

	

Democracy can be though of as the institutionalisation of the public use of reason jointly exercised by autonomous citizens. p23

The communitarian conception of the republican model is too idealistic, dependent on pre political concepts of virtue. p24

A discourse-theoretic conception of democracy draws legitimacy from the procedures that enable fair bargaining and deliberation under equality. p24  A syndrome depending on a tightly regulated network of bargaining and argumentation. p25

The public opinion that is worked up via democratic procedures into communicative power cannot rule itself. p29
