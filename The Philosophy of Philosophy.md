Philosophy concerns ordinary sorts of knowledge but with extraordinary rigour ("unusually painstaking applications of cognitive faculties") 

> The offline employment of conceptual skills is the basis of armchair knowledge in philosophy.

> This account can be applied in particular to philosophical thought experiments, which are typically valid modal arguments. The imagination plays its usual role in them when we evaluate the modal premises.

> The rise of modern logic from Frege onwards has provided philosophers with conceptual instruments of unprecedented power and precision, enabling them to formulate hypotheses with more clarity and determine their consequences with more reliability than ever before. (p45 original)

> Analytic philosophy at its best uses logical rigor and semantic sophistication to achieve a sharpness of philosophical vision unobtainable by other means.' (p46 original) 

> Serious philosophy is always likely to bore those with short attention-spans (p45 original)

> Williamson defends armchair reasoning. He claims that one may arrive at substantial insights by reflecting on the conditions and consequence of our judgments (often in present work called 'our intuitions', a phrase Williamson does not endorse at all, cf.215). The precondition to arrive at such insights in methodological thoroughness. We have to use our faculties (of modal knowledge, inter alia) and express the conceptual structures we find as clearly as possible. (Manuel Bremer review)

> 'Paradigm thought experiments in philosophy are simply valid arguments about counterfactual possibilities' (p207 original).

> 'Our evidence in philosophy consists of a miscellaneous mass of knowledge, expressed in terms of all kind, some from ordinary language, some from the theoretical vocabulary of various disciplines. ... Whatever we know is legitimate evidence' (p277 original).

Arm chair reasoning differs from empiric reasoning.  While expirience plays a role in forming our judgements, arm chair reasoning concerns the judgement at hand and no direct experience of the judgement at hand is necessary.
