# Discours sur l’économie politique

### Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1755)


Economy can refer to the management of a household or the state.

The two are not the same owing to their differing epistemic and moral requirements.

Parental authority is derived from natural strength and instinct. Political authority is derived only from convention.

There should only be a single authority. Women should be excluded from authority owning to their propensity for inaction. Equality in authority should be excluded because decisions can then be made from marginal changes.

Natural instinct drives a father to promote the interests of his family, but drives the magistrate to promote his own.

The analogy between parent and political ruler is a false one.

Public economy or government is distinct from supreme authority or sovereignty.

Political society is analogous to the human body.

The general will is what ever promotes the welfare of the whole body politic.

The general will is not directed to foreigners - for them, it is a particular will of self-interest.

Every society is made up of smaller societies. The general will is relative to a group.  The most general will is the voice of god.

The general will always represents the common good but those in power often act for their own interests. 

Political economy can be characterised as popular or tyrannical depending on the alignment of public and ruler's interests.

A legitimate government is one whose object is the good of the people - it must follow the general will.  But to follow the general will, it must first be distinguished from the particular. To will requires freedom, but freedom requires protections and an authority.  Only adherence to the law can make freedom and authority compatible.

The most important duty of a rule is observance of the law.  No obligations can be held to someone who rejects obligations.

Government is the protector not master of the law.  The honourable ruler governs men's wills, not actions.

The spirit of the law ought guide particular cases. The general will is the source of the law, and the general will is what is most equitable to the people.

The people become what the government makes them.  Make the people love the law to ensure their obedience.

Virtue is the conformity of the particular wills with the general.

Public morality is critical to ensure support of political authority.  The people must be motivated to obey laws for the right reasons.  People will willingly accept authority if it serves the general will.

Terror is the inevitable substitute for duty when laws do not serve the general will

The ruler who rules on behalf of the people is infinitely more powerful than the one who rules for himself. All his energies may be directed outward rather than to fight off usurpers.

Solidarity requires shared interests.  Patriotism is effective because solidarity with all of humanity is too difficult.

Patriotism can only flourish when people's interests are promoted.  Injustice for some is incompatible with the general will

The purpose of a society is the advancement of its members. Individual sacrifice is virtuous, utilitarian sacrifice is tyranny.

While laws should protect the people, they are often used against them, and often in the name of the common good.  The worst excesses occur from inequality.

A most important function of government is limiting inequality - structurally rather than by redistribution.

Patriotism requires liberty. Liberty requires virtue. Virtue requires citizenship. Citizenship requires education.

To create solidarity, one must educate with equality

Property is a fundamental right of citizenship.  Protecting it requires balancing freedom and cost.

People will not voluntarily contribute when they do no benefit.

The most important rule of administration is finance.  Taxation is a necessary evil.

The state always demands more revenue. The best way to ensure economy is by limiting it.

Foreign conquests are typically the result of a ruler's desire for more power.

State size has scales of diseconomy. The bigger, the more burdensom the taxation.

In order to enjoy the protections of law, one must submit to it.

Taxation require consent.  By the same argument, so does authority.

The rich benefit significantly more from property rights than the poor.  Fairness suggests that bear the burden of enforcement.

Excessive taxation of an asset discourages its full utilisation.


"Every political society is composed of other smaller societies of different kinds ... all individuals who are united by a common interest compose as many others ... and the proper observation of whose various relations is the true knowledge of public morals and manners."

"The influence of all these tacit or formal associations causes, by the influence of their will, as many different modifications of the public will. The will of these particular societies has always two relations; for the members of the association, it is a general will; for the great society, it is a particular will; and it is often right with regard to the first object, and wrong as to the second."

"An individual may be a devout priest, a brave soldier, or a zealous senator, and yet a bad citizen. A particular resolution may be advantageous to the smaller community, but pernicious to the greater."

"...unhappily personal interest is "always" found in inverse ratio to duty, and increases in proportion as the association grows narrower..."

"...in order to will, it is necessary to be free..." 

"It is certain, at least, that the greatest talent a ruler can possess is to disguise his power, in order to render it less odious, and to conduct the State so peaceably as to make it seem to have no need of conductors."
