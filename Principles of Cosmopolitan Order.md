Principles of Cosmopolitan Order
================================

Cosmopolitanism is concerned to disclose the ethical, cultural, and legal basis of political order in a world where political communities and states matter, but not only and exclusively.  p1

While states are hugely important vehicles to aid the delivery of effective regulation, equal liberty, and social justice, they should not be thought of as ontologically privileged. p1

Typically 2 accounts of cosmopolitanism: one which is local and assigned to us by birth and another which is “truly great and truly common” (Seneca). vs Allegiance is owed, first and foremost, to the moral realm of all humanity, not to the contingent groupings of nation, ethnicity, and class. p1

Thick Cosmopolitanism: allegiance *only* owed to humanity
Thin Cosmopolitanism: allegiance *also* owed to humanity

Requires "they must acknowledge these as morally contingent and that their most important duties are to humanity as a whole and its overall developmental requirements." p2

Focuses on claims of being heard "Cosmopolitan right meant the capacity to present oneself and be heard within and across political communities it was the right to enter dialogue without artificial constraint and delimitation" p2

Asserts 8 principles of cosmopolitanism: 

1. equal worth and dignity
2. active agency
3. personal responsibility and accountability
4. consent
5. collective decision-making about public matters through voting procedures
6. inclusiveness and subsidiarity
7. avoidance of serious harm
8. sustainability. 

Claims these are all justified by:

1. the metaprinciple of autonomy 
2. the metaprinciple of impartialist reasoning.
