# Poor Thought Experiments? A Comment on Peijnenburg and Atkinson


> SUMMARY. In their paper, 'When are thought experiments poor ones?' (Peijnenburg and Atkinson, 2003, Journal of General Philosophy of Science 34, 305-322), Jeanne Peijnenburg and David Atkinson argue that most, if not all, philosophical thought experiments are "poor" ones with "disastrous consequences" and that they share the property of being poor with some (but not all) scientific thought experiments. Noting that unlike philosophy, the sciences have the resources to avoid the disastrous con sequences, Peijnenburg and Atkinson come to the conclusion that the use of thought experiments in science is in general more successful than in philosophy and that instead of concocting more "recherche" thought experiments, philosophy should try to be more empirical. In this comment I will argue that Peijnenburg's and Atkinson's view on thought experiments is based on a misleading characterization of both, the dialec tical situation in philosophy as well as the history of physics. By giving an adequate account of what the discussion in contemporary philosophy is about, we will arrive at a considerably different evaluation of philosophical thought experiments.

>  if we wish to keep philosophizing a respectable scientific activity: the possibility to work on philosophical problems jointly and with a division of labour. p 374

>  a rather broad meaning in the (philosophical) vernacular and includes, as Eike
Brendel4 and others have pointed out, also imaginary cases described in physics textbooks. These thought experiments are usually meant to
help students of physics understand the implications of certain theo ries and should be judged in relation to how well they accomplish that task. p 375

They can be used for propoganda and riducule p 375

Conditions of critical thought experiements (p376)

1. It is the aim of a destructive thought experiment to induce justified belief revision in the addressee.

2. To achieve this aim, a certain state of affairs is described which is claimed to be conceivable.

3. The aim is intended to be achieved without realizing the described state of affairs or assuming that the state of affairs really obtains.

>  [in] Cohnitz (2006) I have at some length defended the view that, in fact, the function of thought experiments in philosophy is to prepare the common ground upon which theories to resolve philosophical puzzles are to be constructed. p389

> Thought experiments constitute the common ground from which we start our philosophical analysis. p389
