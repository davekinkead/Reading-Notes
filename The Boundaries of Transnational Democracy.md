# The boundaries of transnational democracy: alternatives to the all-affected principle

Johan Schaffer 2012

Schaffer defines the problem as "how to delimit the political community relevant for democracy." p2

His argument is against the all affected principle - that it "does not actually give any guidance for delineating a political community but that it does give some absurd recommendations if we were to try to approximate it in political decision making." p3

It's appeal is obvious - "the all-affected principle seems to expound some classical democratic notions about autonomy and consent...." Aristotle's "ruling and being ruled in turn"....Roman law "what concerns all, all must discuss and approve" ... "liberty means living according to laws that you have given yourself" p3

But the AAP requires a complementary theory about affectedness - this might be an objective claim or subjective one.  One definition could be "you are affected when something bad happens to you through no fault of your own." p4

However, "different people will count as affected by the same decision depending on which theory of affectedness we choose" p5

Also (incorrectly) notes that the AAP results in a regress (but this only occurs when attempting to solve the BP with a democratic procedure) p8

The AAP does however result in fickle boundaries - different jurisdictions for each issue. p9  This threatens democratic rights as these are dependent on political equality _within_ units. p10

The all-affected principle has two components: to participate in making a decision and to be affected by that decision.... "the all-affected principle is equally satisfied if you participate in making a decision that affects you or if you do not participate in making a decision that does not affect you." p11

Agne's maximal autonomy principle: p15

> that people be included in political procedures to the extent that their inclusion yields the greatest amount of autonomy to the greatest number of people, while accounting for both those whose who are included and those who are excluded, and accounting for actions performed both individually and collectively.

"borders by their very nature affect both those who are included and those who are excluded, a conceptual feature of borders that the all-affected principle cannot escape" p15

One consequence however is it becomes " legitimate to rob some people of their autonomy to maximise aggregate autonomy for everyone" p16

"Democratic autonomy implies living by laws that you have given yourself and having means by which to assert your interests against the government." p17

"This subject- to-the-law principle, as I call it, solves some, if not all, of the problems that follow from the all-affected principle." p17 - No it doesn't, it completely ignore the issue of who should be subjected in the first place!

"Neither of the three alternatives considered here solve the fundamental boundary problem in democratic theory, but they all advance upon the indeterminate all-affected principle. The subject-to- the-law principle seems to be least problematic, substantiating a precise claim: that any already existing lawgiver should be democratically governed by those subject to the laws it issues." p21

Perhaps the problem is unsolvable "these attempts to solve the boundary problem demonstrate that it is unsolvable in principle: a community cannot lift itself by the hair and provide its own democratic justification" ... "we can still solve boundary problems in both theory and practice, but we cannot always justify such solutions in terms of democratic principles." p22

On Chris Brown: p22

> “Politics is about practical action in a realm where no answer can be other than provisional, not about the application of formulae concerning matters such as social justice – and it ought not to be surprising that when formulaic approaches are made to subjects such as the legitimacy of borders the argument quite soon breaks down.”
