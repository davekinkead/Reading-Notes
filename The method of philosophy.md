# The method of philosophy

## Robert Sokolowski

It is notoriously difficult for philosophers to explain what they do. This is because (in part) philosophy has no identifiable domain as its subject matter p515

A second reason lies in its method.  "The method of philosophical thinking is not obvious" ... "philosophy appears to be an arcane intellectual disciple, a form of thinking whose ways are esoteric and obscure." p515

"Philosophy is the intellectual activity that works with distinctions." "...it works with distinction, brings them out and dwells on them, dwells with them, showing how and why the things that it has distinguished _must_ be distinguished form one another." p516

  - that clarify the nature of things
  - that obliterates false distinctions

"Philosophy does not just make claims: it makes claims based on distinctions that provide the argument for the claims." p517

"Philosophy is the art of differential diagnosis, done for its own sake." p517

All inference involves distinction.  To infer from premise to conclusion, we need to distinguish premises from conclusions.  p517

"...what happens in philosophy is that we interrupt our focus on what is being said and we turn to the distinctions that permit the things and states of affairs we are concerned with to appear.  We turn to what normally remains latent." p518

Philosophy will tell you what you already know, while pretending to tell you something you don't know. p518

The refutational work of philosophy usually involves showing what was once thought to be a legitimate distinction is merely a verbal dispute. p520
