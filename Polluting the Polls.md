Yet the right to vote does not imply the rightness of voting. (p535)

Argument Outline
P1 One has an obligation not to engage in collectively harmful activities when refraining from such activities does not impose significant personal costs.
P2. Voting badly is to engage in a collectively harmful activity, while
abstaining imposes low personal costs.
C. Therefore, one should not vote badly.

"let us say that bad voting occurs when a citizen votes without sufficient reason for harmful or unjust policies or for candidates that are likely to enact harmful or unjust policies." (p537)

It is also acceptable to vote for a candidate who is the lesser of two evils. Voting for a bad candidate may be better abstaining if that makes it likely a worse candidate will win.

"The claim that voters ought not to vote badly does not imply the stronger claim that they must vote only for the most optimal candidate." (p538)

"The most common forms of bad voting are voting 1) from immoral beliefs, 2) from ignorance, or 3) from epistemic irrationality and bias." (p538)

"A collectively harmful activity is an activity that is harmful when many people engage in it, though it might not be harmful (or is negligibly harmful) when only a few individuals engage in it." (p539)

"The default moral position is that everyone causing the problem should bear at least some of the burden of correcting it." (p541)

"If restraining oneself from voting caused significant personal harm, then individuals might be permitted to vote badly." (p541)

"I have the political right to X’ does not imply ‘It is morally right for me to X’" (p544)

"people should not vote badly, but no one should force them not to vote badly." (p545)

"Voting on the moral virtue of a candidate counts as good voting only when the candidate’s moral virtue is evidence that she will not enact harmful policies." (p546)
