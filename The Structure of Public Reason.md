# The Structure of Public Reason

**Jonathon Quong** 2009

"In order to successfully justify the exercise of political power to all citizens, most theorists of public reason claim that we must appeal only to public or political values which all persons (or all suitable idealized persons) are assumed to endorse. " p1

Gauss' 3 Error's of Public Reason: p1

- Error of Consensus - that laws must be justified to some shared view
- Error of Symmetry - whatever is true about reasons to support a law also holds to reasons for rejecting it
- Error of Deliberation - that citizens must adhere to certain first order norms of public deliberation

Quong's position is to reject Gauss' weaker justification of public reason.

"political liberalism is premised on the claim that the exercise of political power ought to be publicly justifiable to the citizens over whom that power is exercised." p3

Political liberalism is a normative idea that applies to politics. p3

"The idea of public reason entails a particular version of _democratic deliberation_" .... "that they only support laws that can be justified by appeal to _public reasons_." p3

The idea is that while it is acceptable to support a law for any reason (comprehensive or personal beliefs), laws must _also_ be justified by public reasons acceptable to all resonable people. p3

The _duty of civility_ requires that citizens refrain from appeal to comprehensive (personal) justifications. p3

"Rawlsâ€™s idea of public reason is not a simple logical implication of the commitment to public justification, but rather a substantive position regarding the normative features of democratic practice." p4

Support for the Rawlsian conception:

- likely to lead to publicly acceptable justifications
- intrinsic value in the respect for others as equals
- epistemic benefits from maximising information brought into the public domain

"Reasonable persons, as we know, are characterized by their acceptance of society as a fair system of social cooperation between free and equal citizens, and by their acceptance of the burdens of judgement and the consequent fact of reasonable pluralism." p6

"if we have justified something to one reasonable person, we have justified it to all reasonable people. " p6

"the worry that the Rawlsian ideal of public reason is too demanding in the sense that it assumes reasonable citizens must all endorse a given political decision for the very same reasons. " p7

Plural public reason requires that agents can come to agreement for different public reasons. p7
