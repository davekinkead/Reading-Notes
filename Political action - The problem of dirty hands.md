# Political action: The problem of dirty hands

Waltzer examines whether one can ever face a moral dilemma - a situation where one must choose between two courses of action both of which it would be wrong to undertake. p160

Dirty Hands occur when the act of government my be right from a utiliatarian perspective but still guilty of a moral wrong. p161  It derives from an effort to refuse moral absolutism. p162

Politicians are typically thought to have dirty hands as they face these dilemmas systematically and frequently. p162
