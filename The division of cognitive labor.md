# The division of cognitive labor

The investigation ...

 > Is it possible that there should be a mismatch between the demands of individual rationality and those of collective (or community) rationality? Could it turn out that high- minded inquirers, following principles of individual rationality, should do a poor job of promoting the epistemic projects of the community that they constitute? p6

 The thesis ...

 >  ... we sometimes want to maintain cognitive diversity even in instances where it would be reasonable for all to agree that one of two theories was inferior to its rival, and we may be grateful to the stubborn minority who continue to advocate problematic ideas. p7

 There is collective epistemic value in pressing ahead with divergent views ...

 >  As Thomas Kuhn2 remarks, it was probably unreasonable for Joseph Priestley to persist as long as he did. Yet, from the point of view of the community of chemists, it was no bad thing that Priestley (and a few others) gave the phlogiston theory every last chance. p7

 A solution ... 

 > we can differentiate belief in a theory from pursuit of research designed to apply or extend that theory ... Whereas it may be rational for each of the scientists to believe the theory that is better supported by the available evidence, it may not be rational for each of them to pursue that theory, and what the community cares about is the distribution of pursuit not the distribution of belief. p8

 Which then raises a new problem ...

> The idea that it is rational for a person to believe the better-supported theory seems, however, to be based on supposing that that person's aim is to achieve true beliefs ... p8

Individual epsitemic diversity improves collective knowledge when we don't know the truth ahead of time. To maximise collective knowledge, solve for optimal

    p1(n) + p2(N-n) - p1&2(N)

In some cases, non-epistemic motivation (ie fame) can work in the community's favour by encouraging divergent research.

> Social structures within the scientific community can work to the advantage of the community epistemic projects by exploiting the personal motives of individuals. p21
