# Philosophical Explanations

## Robert Nozick

The overarching theme seems to be that philosophy has great value in more than just truth seeking...

> That a philosophy aims at a conclusion, though, does not guarantee it will reach it. .... We need no devalue a philosophical inquiry that is teleologically directed p3

> A successful philosophical argument ... _forces_ someone to a belief. p4

> Philosophical arguments can serve to elaborate a view, to delineate its contents. p5

A philosophical theory is introduced to explain things, render them coherent, and be better understood. p8

To argue from contradiction:

> Some statements r1...rn are assumed or accepted or taken for granted, and there is a tension between these statements and another statement p; they appear to exclude p's holding true.  Let us term the ri apparent excluders (of p).  Since the statement p also is accepted, we face the question of how p is possible, given its apparent excluders.  p9

> I believe increased understanding can be produced even by an explanation known to be false; seeing what in principle could give rise to a phenomenon illuminates some of its aspects by the way it latches onto these. p11

> explanation locates something in actuality, showing its actual connections with other actual things, while understanding locates it in a network of possibility, showing the connections it would have to other non-actual things or processes. p12

The philosophy attempts to explain how p is possible, the scientist how p is true. p12

> A proof transmits conviction from its premisses down to its conclusion, so it must start with premisses (q) for which there already is conviction; otherwise, there will be nothing to transmit. An explanation, on the other hand, may introduce explanatory hypotheses (q) which are not already believed, from which to deduce p in explanatory fashion.  p14
