# Before Athens - Early Popular Government in Phoenicia and Greek City-States

__Stephen Stockwell__

Phoenician records are difficult to find because papyrus was primarily used. p35

What counts as a Democracy? "Robinson distinguishes between democracy with a ‘rigorously defined system’ of participation and equality, and popular government ‘with “the people” having at least some say in the direction of public affairs’ (Robinson, 1997: 11–12)." p36

## Phoenicia 

There were pockets of popular assemblage and government throughout Phoenicia.  The Phoenician period commenced with strong monarchs but ended with weak kings or none at all.

"Phoenician civilization was based on city-states such as Sidon, Tyre, Arwad, Byblos, Beirut and Ugarit on the eastern edge of the Mediterranean, around present-day Lebanon. 1500BC" p36

"Most significantly, the Phoenicians were exposed to the shift that Israel first brought to politics: the state depended not on the king’s relationship with God, but on the peo- ple’s participation in the covenant. " p37

Mosaic "law ordained a limited monarchy and a social structure tending towards egalitarianism, with a citizenry that could itself choose judges able to lead the people in times of turmoil" p37

"On the balance of evidence from the Amarna Letters, it can be concluded that some Phoenician municipalities were ruled, from time to time, by sovereign assemblies with deliberative functions; and the participation of citizens, and thus democratic activity, is evident in the earliest period of the Phoenician city-states." p39

"after Nebuchadnezzar II’s siege of Tyre (585–572 BC), that city was without the monarchy for seven years and was administered for short terms by suffetes (or judges)....Tyre was ‘a republic headed by elective magistrates’" p40

"he Carthaginian constitution required two suffetes, who were elected annually to gov- ern on the advice of the senate of elders. Where there was a lack of unanimous agreement between the suffetes and the senate, the popu- lar assembly was called upon to decide the issue." p41 - Aristotle described Carthage as an ologarchy.

"In Carthage therefore the influence of the people in the policy of the state had already risen to be supreme, while at Rome the Senate was at the height of its power: and so, as in the one measures were deliberated upon by the many, in the other by the best men."
(Polybius, 1889: Histories, VI.51)

## Greece

There was significant Phoenician influence on Greek life via trade, affecting the Greek renaissance of culture, language, mathematics and politics.

"The rise of this emerging class prompted various city-states to experiment with new political forms. One idea central to the Greek enlightenment is that of democratic governance." p43
