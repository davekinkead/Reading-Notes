## Model-Building in Philosophy

### Timothy Williamson

> The models are typically presented in mathematical terms (p1)

> When a system resists direct study, because it is so complex or hard to observe, model-building constitutes a key fall-back strategy. Studying a model often yields insight into the phenomena it models. 

> When one model is replaced by another that captures more about how the phenomena work, science progresses.

> progress may consist more in the development of better models than in the discovery of universal laws.

> macroscopic phenomena are typically too complex and messy to obey many informative exceptionless generalizations framed in macroscopic terms.

> Not only can philosophy make progress through model-building, it has been doing so for quite some time.

> Philosophers of science use the word “model” in a confusing variety of ways, as do scientists themselves.  (p3)

> “model-building” to identify a specific recognizable type of theoretical activity that some but not all scientists engage in, some but not all of the time (Godfrey-Smith 2006a; Weisberg 2007).

> a model of something is a hypothetical example of it.

> The point of the qualification “hypothetical” is that the example is presented by an explicit description in general terms, rather than by pointing to an actual case.

> For the model-building methodology to work well, the description of the hypothetical example must be precise and specific enough to be formally tractable.

> The mathematical clarity of the description helps make direct study of the model easier than direct study of the phenomenon itself.

> Moreover, the mathematical consequences of the description may turn out to be similar enough to descriptions in similar terms of the observed behaviour of the target real-life phenomenon for the model to provide considerable theoretical insight into the target. (p3)

> we might not have expected impossible models to have such cognitive value, but it has become clear that they can. (p3)

> The purely logical consequences of the description do not depend on the intended interpretations of its non-logical terms; (p3)

> the non-logical terms are not idle, for they are needed to co-ordinate comparisons with the real-life phenomenon. (p3)

> They are typically intended to be easier to explore than the real thing; simplicity and idealization contribute to that. (p3)

> To build a model is just to identify by description a hypothetical example which we intend to learn about in hope of thereby learning about the more general subject matter it exemplifies. (p4)

> When we explore a model by valid deductive reasoning from the model description, we learn necessary truths of the general conditional form “If a given case satisfies the model description, then it satisfies this other description too.” (p4)

> we can also learn unconditional though vaguer truths of the general form “This model description fits the phenomenon better than that one does in the following ways,” where the fit is usually approximate.  (p4)

> The need for model-building is hardest to avoid where the complex, messy nature of the subject matter tends to preclude informative exceptionless universal generalizations. The paradigm of such complexity and mess is the human world. (p5)

> The branch of epistemology known as formal epistemology is much concerned with model-building. (p5)

> When one looks back on the vast body of results produced by model-building in formal epistemology over the past half-century, it seems idle to deny that considerable progress has been made in understanding the epistemic subtleties of many kinds of situation. (p6)

> In the natural and social sciences, models are often tested by their predictions of measurable quantities. Models of epistemic logic typically make no such predictions, (p6)

> Model-building is more relevant to showing that a conclusion does not follow from some premises. (p8)

> model descriptions facilitate the construction of uncontentious logic-models with the appropriate mathematical structure. (p8)

> when a model description seems informally consistent with a philosophical theory, one can often construct a corresponding logic-model on which the theory is true, and thereby demonstrate that it is logically consistent: it does not logically entail a contradiction. (p8)

> Thus one advantage of model-building—not the only one— is to make us more efficient and accurate at mapping the logical space in which we are theorizing. Without such a map, we blunder about in a fog, bumping into unexpected obstacles, falling over cliffs. (p8)

> Simplicity conduces to computational feasibility, so that we can in practice derive the model’s mathematical properties by deductive reasoning from its description.  (p8)

> Simple models have other, less obvious advantages. The more adjustable parts a model has, the more opportunities it offers the model-builder to rig the results, to gerrymander the model by setting parameters and arranging structure in ad hoc ways to fit preconceived prejudices. (p9)

> Although model-building already plays a significant role in philosophy, philosophers have not fully adjusted to its methodological implications. For instance, counterexamples play a much smaller role in a model-building enterprise than they do in traditional philosophy.  (p9)

>  What defeats a model is not a counterexample but a better model, one that retains its predecessor’s successes while adding some more of its own. (p9)

> Another respect in which rigorous-minded philosophers may find the method of model-building alien is that selecting and interpreting models is an art—in science as well as in philosophy. (p10)

> Model-building already plays a significant role in contemporary philosophy. One neglected form of progress in philosophy over the past fifty years has been the development of better and better formal models of significant phenomena.  (p11)

> Philosophy can do still better in the future by applying model-building methods more systematically and self-consciously. (p11)
