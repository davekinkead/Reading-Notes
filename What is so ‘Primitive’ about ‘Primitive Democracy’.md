# What is so ‘Primitive’ about ‘Primitive Democracy’? 
## Comparing the Ancient Middle East and Classical Athens

"‘Athenian Revolution’ might be better understood not so much by what the Athenians did – as most of their activities have at least some precedent – as by what they wrote down. " p19

Greek philosophers "appear to have viewed democracy as a bad example of government, in which the brutish will of the masses usurps the natural position of the wealthy and well-educated elite." p20

"Athenians were certain in their belief that the Greeks had a unique proclivity for democracy and that they alone had invented this advanced form of government." p21

## Athenian and Middle Eastern assemblies

- Shuruppak, Attica, Ashur (Assyria), Israelite, Summarians, 

### Athens

"The story of classical Greek democracy really begins when the aristocracy of Athens ‘issued’ Cleisthenes with a ‘mandate’, around 508 BC, to formulate a political system that would eschew the cen- tralisation of power." - __Demokratia__ p22

All adult male citizens were encouraged to attend these assemblies, which convened about forty times a year and frequently attracted numbers of around 6,000.  Communication was predominately one-way and the assembly was weakened by tow ologarchic coups p22.

"The re-assertion of democracy in Athens (403/2 BC) saw the power of the assembly severely weakened and restricted. Not even the most privileged citizen could table a motion according to his whim. Instead, the assembly could only discuss and decide matters placed on the agenda by the council (boule), and even then the People’s Court could overturn the will of the people." p22

"The council set the issues that needed to be ratified, the elite citizens delivered them in well-crafted and populist speeches, and the citizens, for their part, served as a rubber-stamp that could be erased by the court." p23

### Other Assemblies

"There is evidence of ancient Middle Eastern assemblies dating back some 2,000 years before the reforms of Cleisthenes, which are remarkably similar in their democratic impetus." p23

"they functioned alongside a sophisticated matrix of other councils and courts, and were divided between ‘an upper house of “elders” and a lower house of “men”'" p23

Iraelite cities "When deliberations came to a close, a proclamation was made that reiterated the key decisions and announced the people’s consent. Later, during times of monarchy, such assemblies continued to wield ‘at least strong advisory powers, if not full veto power, over the king’" p24

"In fact ascension to the throne itself required neither blood lineage nor divine right, but the consent of the majority, which ‘had the power to reject any candidate for the kingship, even the heir apparent’ (Wolf, 1947: 105)."

### Justice

The rule of law was a key element of Athenian democracy. "democratic cities are governed by the established laws’ and all citizens have the obligation ‘to obey the laws we have established and to punish those who do not obey them’ (Aeschines, 2001 [347 BC]: 1.4–6). "

"‘everyone is equal before the law’ (Thucydides, 1972 [410 BC]: II.37). " p25

"all citizens had the right to trial in the assembly before they could be executed." until 362BC when a seperate law system was developed. p25

Elsewhere:

"the king demonstrated his concern for social justice by claiming at the beginning of the prologue that his laws are designed ‘to establish justice in the land, to eliminate cries for justice, to erad- icate enmity and armed violence, to bring well-being to the lands of Sumer and Akkad’ (cited in Roth, 1997 [1995]: Epilogue I)." p25 -- 1930BC

Citizen assemblies for justice were common in Egypt & Babylon p26

### Voting

Athens used a combination of direct issue voting, voting for positions and sortition for positions.  Most positions had limited terms of 12 months and extensive public oversight. p27

"Finally, every citizen had more than a good chance of being chosen by lot for short-term posi- tions, such as that of chairman, which was of great prominence, or that of a low-ranking support staff" p27

In Mesopotamia, Kings were popularly elected during times of emergency with their reign limited to the duration of the emergency. 

"Ebla, around 2500 BC, we find that the king was elected by popular vote ‘for a seven-year term and shared power with a council of elders’ " p27

In Kanesh, Assyria 2000BC, "voting was practised whereby the congregation would divide into three groups and each group would deliberate and vote independently before reconvening in a plenary where the final votes were counted" p28

### Rights & Freedoms

In Athens, equality and liberty (for citizens) was fundamental. "right to isegoria, ‘freedom of speech’ – the freedom to voice their con- cerns in front of their fellow citizens." p28

"However, the assembly could punish what it considered as dangerous ideas and it is worth pointing out that the Athenians went against the very principles of isegoria in their trial and execution of the philosopher Socrates, who was found guilty of athe- ism and corrupting the minds of the young and sentenced to die by ingesting hemlock.8" p29

"Throughout the Babylonian, Assyrian and Israelite assemblies, for example, each citizen had the right to express his opinion, while the participants openly pointed out the contradictions and inconsistencies in their opponents’ arguments." p29

### Exclusion

"the exclusion of the majority of the people of Attica from the democratic process. Indeed citizenship itself was limited by five defining characteristics: age (adult), gender (male), ancestry (Athenian), mili- tary service (completed military training) and birth (free-born people only, not slaves or children of slaves)." p30

"In addition, those with low levels of education or socio-economic status would have been excluded from cit- izenship either tacitly or directly; " p31

Elsewhere, "Babylonian or Assyrian Empires found it difficult to garner consensus, they extended rather than restricted the circle of participants, often involving commoners, teenagers and women" p31

Babylon employ a class system of citizens with full rights, commoners who were allowed to attend the assembly and slaves with no rights. p31
