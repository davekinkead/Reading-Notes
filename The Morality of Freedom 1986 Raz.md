The Morality of Freedom
=======================

Joseph Raz 1986

**The Pre-Emption Thesis:**
the fact that an authority requires performance of an action is a reason for its performance which is not to be added to all other relevant reasons when assessing what to do, but should exclude and take the place of some of them. (p46)

**The Dependency Thesis:**
All authoritative directives should be based on reasons which already independently apply to the subjects of the directives and are relevant to their action in the circumstances covered by the directive. (p47)

**The No-Difference Thesis:**
The exercise of authority should make no difference to what its subjects ought to do. (p48)

The dependency thesis merely constrains the justifications and deliberations of an authority to reasons that already apply to subjects.  The no-difference thesis is a much strong claim that an authority give no additional reasons for action, just additional evidence of what is right or wrong.

The pre-emptive thesis only follows from the dependency thesis if the authoritative directive is bound by the latter.  i.e. the directive cannot preemptive prior reasons for actions if it isn't dependent on or considered against those reasons. (interpretation from p59 - disagreed on p61)
