# The Rise of Illiberal Democracy

Liberalism is distinct from democracy, even though most people conflate democracy with liberal democracy. p22

"Democracy is flourishing; constitutional liberalism is not." p22

"elections are rarely as free and fair as in the West today, but they do reflect the reality of popular participation in politics and support for those elected" p23 - cites Iran as an illiberal democracy

"Freedom in the World, has separate rankings for political liberties and civil liberties, which correspond roughly with democracy and constitutional liberalism, respectively." p23

50% of democratising states have more political than civil liberties, with illiberal democracies increasing from 22% to 35% of democratising states. p23

"few illiberal democracies have matured into liberal democracies; if anything, they are moving toward heightened illiberalism." p23

Democracy is simply the rule of the people.  Quotes Samuel Huntington "Democracy is one public virtue, not the only one,"

"If a country holds competitive, multiparty elections, we call it democratic. When public participation in politics is increased, for example through the enfranchisement of women, it is seen as more democratic." p23

"To have democracy mean, subjectively, "a good government" renders it analytically useless." p24

"Constitutional liberalism, on the other hand, is not about the procedures for selecting government, but rather government's goals....that seeks to protect an individual's autonomy and dignity against coercion" p24

"In almost all of its variants, constitutional liberalism argues that human beings have certain natural (or "inalienable") rights and that governments must accept a basic law, limiting its own powers, that secures them." p24

"The Magna Carta, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the American Constitution, and the Helsinki Final Act are all expressions of constitutional liberalism." p24

Constitutional liberalism predates electoral democracy throughout Western Europe.

"The "Western model" is best symbolized not by the mass plebiscite but the impartial judge." p25

In post war East Asia, most countries followed a path of authoritarianism -> autocracy -> liberalising autocracy -> liberal semi-democracy.  Most remain semi-democratic but "have accorded their citizens a widening sphere of economic, civil, religious, and limited political rights." p26 

"Constitutional liberalism has led to democracy, but democracy does not seem to bring constitutional liberalism." p26

"Britain's legacy of law and administration has proved more beneficial than France's policy of enfranchising some of its colonial populations." p26

On Hong Kong "Until 1991 it had never held a meaningful election, but its government epitomized constitutional liberalism, protecting its citizens' basic rights and administering a fair court system and bureaucracy." p27

"Constitutional liberalism is about the limitation of power, democracy about its accumulation and use" p27

Usurpation of power occurs more easily when there is less internal competition for power ie in presidencies rather than prime ministerships

"But except in emergencies like war, illiberal means are in the long run incompatible with liberal ends." p29

" two common, and often mistaken, assumptions -- that the forces of democracy are the forces of ethnic harmony and of peace." p30

"What is distinctive about the American system is not how democratic it is but rather how undemocratic it is, placing as it does multiple constraints on electoral majorities." p32

" the absence of free and fair elections should be viewed as one flaw, not the definition of tyranny." p33
