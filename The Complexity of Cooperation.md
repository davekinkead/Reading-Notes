# The complexity of cooperation

## Axelrod 1997

> The purpose of ABM is to understand properties of complex social systems through the analysis of simulations. p3

> The trick [in ABM] is to specify how the agents interact, and then observe properties that occur at the level of the whole society. p3

> Agent based modelling is a way of doing thought experiments. p4

> Although the assumptions may be simple, the consequences of them may not be at all obvious. p4

> Although ABM employs simulation, it does not aim to provide an accurate representation of a particular empirical application. p5

## Evolving new strategies

> In complex environments, individuals are not fully able to analyse the situation and calculate their optimal strategy. p14

> Biological evolution has been highly successful in discovering complex and effective methods of adapting to very rich environmental situations. p14

Mutation is one very effective strategy. p14

Topics amenable to simulation: p27

  - mutation
  - crossover
  - inversion
  - coding principles
  - dominant and recessive genes
  - gradual vs punctuated evolution
  - population viscosity
  - speciation & niching



## Replication of agent based models

A process called "alignment of computational models" will become essential. p184

> It seems fundamental to us to be able to determine whether two models claiming to deal with the same phenomena can, or cannot, produce the same results. p184

Alignment of similar models is necessary "if computational modelling is to become a significant medium of theoretical exchange" p188

Alignment and equivalence testing should be performed by all modellers. (p203)
