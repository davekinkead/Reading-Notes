# Hobbes's State of Nature: A Modern Bayesian Game-Theoretic Analysis

>  I claim that any game-theoretic model that does not incorporate uncertainty into the picture is the wrong model. ... I use Bayesian game theory to show how universal conflict can break out in the state of nature—even when the majority of the population would strictly prefer to cooperate and seek peace with other people—due to uncertainty about what type of person the other player is. p485

The Five Conditions of Hobbes’s State of Nature

> C1 (Equality): People’s physical and mental capabilities are roughly equal. p486

> C2 (Competition Due To Scarce Resources): In the state of nature, resources are scarce in such a way that there will inevitably arise situations where two people would want to obtain the same object. p486

> C3 (Two Types of Men): In the state of nature, there exist two types of people: the modest type and the vainglorious type. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that there is a certain proportion of the entire human population that is vainglorious—these are people who enjoy having power over others and who pursue power, not as a means to secure their self-preservation, but for its own sake. p487

> C4 (Non-Universal Egoism): Not everybody seeks to maximize his/her own self-interest (i.e., power.). The modest types, who compose the majority of the entire population, would strictly prefer to cooperate with other people if these other people cooperate in return. By contrast, the vainglorious people are those for whom maximizing self-interest is the primary aim; hence, they would gladly enjoy taking advantage of other people’s good intentions whenever it is to their advantage and thus increase their power. p487

> He explicitly distinguishes two types of people: the modest and the vainglorious. p488

> C5 (Uncertainty): In the state of nature, people cannot reliably know other people’s types. p488

> LEMMA (Preemptive Attack as a Dominant Strategy): In the state of nature, launching a preemptive attack is the dominant strategy for everybody regardless of his/her type. p489

> THEOREM (War of Every Man against Every Man): The state of nature results in a state of war of every man against every man. p489

The Three Desiderata of Hobbes’s State of Nature p490

> 1. It must meet all of the five conditions (C1 through C5) of Hobbes’s state of nature.

> 2. It must show that universal warfare is the unique equilibrium of the state of nature.

> 3. It must show that universal war is suboptimal (i.e., Pareto-inferior): that is, it must show that there is a social state (i.e., universal peace) that everybody would strictly prefer to the state of universal war.

> Many people have tried to model Hobbes’s state of nature as a PD game (Rawls 1971, 1999: 269; Taylor 1976, 1987: ch. 6; Barry 1965: 253–54; Gauthier 1969: 76–89).

> In other words, the vainglorious person and the modest person each has a completely different preference ordering. p492

> It is well-known that many experiments that have been led by contemporary behavior economists show that people tend to cooperate much more often than they defect in psychological experiments designed to mimic the structure of the Prisoner’s Dilemma (see Dawes and Thaler 1988; Cooper et al. 1996). p493

State of nature as a stag hunt - See Skyrms (2004, ch. 1) and Gauthier (1969: 85). Gauthier thinks that Hobbes’s state of nature can be modeled as a PD game in the short term, and as a Stag Hunt game in the long term. See also Moehler (2009). Hampton follows Sen (1967) and calls the game an “Assurance Game.” See Hampton (1986: 67).

> Some scholars have thought that Hobbes’s state of nature can best be modeled as what people, following Kavka (1989), call the Assurance Dilemma (see Kavka 1989 and Dodds and Shoemaker 2002). 

> The Assurance Dilemma is a two-player game in which one player has prisoner’s dilemma preferences, while the other player has stag hunt preferences.

Why Hobbes’s State of Nature is Not an Iterated PD Game

> Some scholars have thought that the state of nature described by Hobbes should be represented as a repeated PD game (see Kavka 1986: ch. 4; Hampton 1986: ch. 3 Taylor 1987).

> However, modeling Hobbes’s state of nature as an iterated PD game has its own merits. The most significant merit is that it seems to explain the universal warfare that is characteristic of the state of nature while showing how people can escape the state of nature and successfully establish a government by themselves. p496

Objection to iteration

> The iterated PD game requires each player to play the PD game with the same opponent repeatedly. I doubt that this would be the case for people living in the state of nature. In the state of nature, it would be far more likely for each person to randomly encounter a different opponent every time the individual happens to interact with somebody. If this is so, then it might be more plausible to model Hobbes’s state of nature as a one-shot game, rather than some repeated game. p497

It doesn't have to be infinite, just of unknown number!!!!!

Hun endorsed iterated interactions:

> One may think that people living in the state of nature know the value of q by their collective past experiences; that is, if many people on average had encountered m vainglorious persons among n people they had interacted with in the past p498
