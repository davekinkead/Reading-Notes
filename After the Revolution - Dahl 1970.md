After the Revolution
====================

Robert Dahl 1970


Part 1
------

Dahl outlines his 3 criteria for authority:

- personal choice
- competence
- economy

**Personal Choice**

Accepting authority only if it corresponds to my wishes is simple to accept (p8).  But if I wish to live with others and in order to avoid the problems of isolation, anarchy, subjection, or despotism (p11), I must accept others as political equals and therefore their personal choices as well (p11).  This leads to some form of majority rule (p14).

But acceptance of majority rule is only rational if I believe I when, when it counts, be on the side of the majority.  If not, then I will demand some other for of protection of my interests.  If I accept others as political equals I am left with 3 possibilities (p21):

- mutual guarantees
- consensual associations
- autonomous decisions

**Competence**

Competence should override personal choice in situations where significant differences in competence exist.  Competence is political neutral and ought be accepted when superior competence exists.

But "on the whole the ordinary man is mote competent than anyone else to decide when and how much he shall intervene on decisions he feels are important to him" (p35).  This makes competence coherent with democracy and equality.

**Economy**

It is only reasonable to participate in decision making when that activity is a good use of your time (p46).  The perfect state is never achievable because the costs of achieving the ideal are greater than what anyone is prepared to bear (p49)

Simple mathematics prevents any form of participatory democracy in large associations (p55).  Representative democracy is a good compromise between the ideal and economy

Part 2
------

Who should participate in the government of a democratic association (p60 ) is a curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem (p59) where there is no theoretical solution to the puzzle, only pragmatic ones (p59)

Principle of Affected Interests is typically offered as a solution and is verily likely the best general principle of inclusion that you are likely to find:

	"Everyone who is affected by the decisions of a government should have the right to participate in that government" p64

But what affects my interest depends on subjective factors (p66) which leads to global government and clashes with the criterion of economy.  It does at least provide a prima facie case for those affected.

Dahl also characterised various forms of democracy: (p69)

- primary (town meeting)
- committee
- referendum
- representative
- delegated authority

Political parties lead to adversarial politics whereas committees lead to consensual democracy (p75).

There is no one best form of government. Dahl advocates 'chinese boxes' of jurisdictions (p93) Rousseau hints in a footnote that confederations are the answer but fails to extrapolate (p87).

As a function of the effect of your vote on the outcome of an election, your effectiveness  necessarily decreases with the number of voters, but as a function of the value of the consequences, your effectiveness often increases with the size of the association (p101).

Dahl's maxims of jurisdictions (p102):

- if the matter is best dealt with via democratic association, make it the smallest association possible
- in considering if a larger association would be better, remember that increased costs come from larger associations.
- Criterion of Economy requires that the number of associations be kept to a minimum.
- Autonomous decision making is often a viable alternative to association.
 

Part 3
------

Polyarchy suffers from an irreparable flaw - the remoteness of the government from the citizen who participates very little in many of the decisions that have crucial importance in his life (p142)

Magical solutions fall into 2 types:

- completely replacing polyarchy in the large unit with primary democracy (which limits economy)
- replace associations too large for primary democracy with units small enough (which limits effectiveness)

Dahl also covers sortition (p149) but only finds it viable for advisory councils
