# Rationality as a Goal of Education

- [critical thinking, development, education, rationality, thinking skills]

Abstract

> Those who believe education should involve more than learning facts often stress either (a) development or (b) thinking skills. A focus on development as a goal of education typically entails a conception of knowledge as organismic, holistic, and internally generated. In con- trast, thinking skills programs commonly assume a mechanistic, re- ductionist perspective in which good thinking consists of some finite number of directly teachable skills. A conception of rationality as a goal of education is proposed that incorporates the complementary strengths and avoids the limitations of the developmental and think- ing skills approaches. Rationality is defined as the self-reflective, in- tentional, and appropriate coordination and use of genuine reasons in generating and justifying beliefs and behavior. Philosophically, rationality is a justifiable goal of education, not only because it is a means to worthwhile ends but because it is an important end in it- self and because it can be promoted via non-indoctrinative means. A psychological account of progressive rationality is provided that pos- tulates continuing multiple interactions of (a) domain-specific devel- opmental stages, (b) the learning of specific thinking skills, and (c) content-specific knowledge. Suggestions are made for fostering ratio- nality at various educational levels. Finally, it is argued that the pro- posed conception of rationality as a goal of education complements
and clarifies a variety of other educational goals.

Education as development

> I will define a developmental program as one that sees development as a relatively global, long-term, internally generated process and that attempts to facilitate that process. (p336)

> Some see development as the primary aim of education (Kohlberg and Mayer, 1972), and some educational programs are explic- itly developmental (Black, 1989). . ... This would include, for exaple, Piagetian programs aimed at facilitating cognitive development (e.g., Schwebel and Raph, 1973) and Kohlbergian moral education programs (e.g., Reimer et al., 1983). (p336)

> Developmental approaches to education share at least two major characteristics: (a) an organismic conception of knowledge and thinking, and (b) a view of change as primarily due to or directed by endogenous factors. I will discuss each of these characteristics in turn. (p337)

  - organically conception of knowledge
  - change from endogenous factors

Education as thinking skills

> The programs and approaches addressed in this section are those that define thinking in terms of specific skills and attempt to foster good thinking not by facilitating some underlying developmental pro- cess but rather through relatively direct inculcation (Adams, 1989; Baron, 1985; Baron and Sternberg, 1987; Beyer, 1990; Blair and Johnson, 1987; Chance, 1986; de Bono, 1983; Hudgins and Edelman, 1988; Miller, 1986; Nisbett et al., 1987; Sternberg and Martin, 1988). (p339

> they appear to be committed to (a) a mechanistic conception of thinking and (b) a view of change as pri- marily due to and directed by exogenous factors.) (p339)

> Thinking is construed as the processing of information. Good thinking, it is assumed, can be understood reductionistically by dissecting it into the specific pro- cesses or thinking skills that comprise it. (p340)

> The focus, in other words, is not on indirectly facili- tating the emergence of new cognitive structures that will enable better thinking (as in a developmental approach), but rather on the direct incul- cation of specific thinking skills. (p340)

  - mechanistic conception of thinking
  - change from exogenous factors

Education as rationality

> Central to the definition is the idea that rationality involves an appeal to reasons (Rescher, 1988; Siegel, 1988; Strike, 1982a). (p342)

> ... an educational program has failed to produce rationality to the extent that students have no reasons for their beliefs and behavior or have reasons that are mutually inconsistent. (p342)

> Rational thinkers purposely decide to think, know they are thinking, know why they are thinking, and can even reflect on the adequacy and effectiveness of their own thought processes. Rationality, in other words, is inherently metacognitive. (p342)

  !!! This conception of rationality excludes computure / AI by definition

> ... the coordination and use of the reasons is normatively appropriate. p(342)

> Rationality means using reasons as a basis for generating new actions and ideas, as well as justifying previous ones. (p342)

  - explanitory
  - metacognitively aware
  - normative
  - generative

Logic and pyschological development

Preschool

> Even when preschool children reach correct conclu- sions they appear to have no sense of their conclusions as conclusions.  (p345)

> Their focus is on the content of the premises and conclusions, not on the relation between them. (p346)

Primary School

> Beginning about age 5 or 6, however, children appear to be increasingly intentional and self-reflective in reaching and evaluating conclusions. ... although their ability to distinguish logically necessary inferences from inferences that are merely plausible, probable, or conventional reveals an implicit awareness of the logical form of arguments, they do not appear to reflect explicitly on the nature and role of logical form (p346)

Middle School

> Beginning about age 11 or 12, there is evidence of movement toward a third, quali- tatively distinct stage at which reflective awareness of logical form is suf- ficiently explicit to distinguish the internal validity of an entire argument (whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises) from the external truth of specific propositions within an argument (whether a specific premise or conclusion is empirically true) (p346)

High School

> Although most adolescents appear capable of Stage 3 understanding about the nature of logic, application of this competence to actual problems is imperfect and continues to develop at least through adolescence (Oâ€™Brien, 1987; Overton, 1990; Overton et al., 1987).
Adults (p346)

Adults

> Further reflection on the nature of logic may yield, in some highly educated adults, an increasingly explicit (Stage 4) metalogical understanding of the nature and interrelations of logical system and natural languages (Moshman, 1990a; Politzer, 1986). (p346)

>  .. it appears that at least some individuals move beyond Stage 3 to a Stage 4 level of explicit metatheoretical awareness involving highly sophisticated conceptions about reality, knowledge, truth, and justifica- tion (Broughton, 1978; Kitchener et al., 1989). (p347)
