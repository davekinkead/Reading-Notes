# Three Philosophical Lessons for the Analysis of Criminal and Military Intelligence

## Abstract

It has recently been suggested that philosophy – in particular, epistemology – has a contribution to make to the analysis of criminal and military intelligence. The present article pursues this suggestion, taking three phenomena that have recently been studied by philosophers, and showing that they have important implications for the gathering and sharing of intelligence, and for the use of intelligence in the determining of strategy. The phenomena discussed are: (1) Simpson’s Paradox, (2) the distinction between resiliency and reliability of data, and (3) the Causal Markov Condition.


## Argument from Simpsons Paradox

"The lesson for the planning and execution of intelligence analysis is that, in order to maximize the intelligence benefits of sharing information, it may be necessary to start one’s analysis all over again. The existence of independent analyses that agree with one’s own results may not corroborate those results. It may, in fact, undermine them." p444

## Argument from Skyrms’ Resiliency Theorem

"When an analyst is dealing with noisy data, and with sources that carry information, not only about events, but also about the reliability of other sources, the mistake of confusing reliability with resilience is a mistake that it is difficult to avoid." p451

## Argument from Markov Chains

Stochastic processes make causal inference very difficult.

"If the Causal Markov Condition were satisfied, such reasoning would be rationally impeccable, but in stochastic chains in which there are unmeasured intermediaries it is provably mistaken." p455
