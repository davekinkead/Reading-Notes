Legal Obligation and Authority
==============================

Leslie Green, SEP Entry

- All legal systems recognize, create, vary and enforce obligations and these obligations are central to the social role of law
- Obligations exist both in the law and to the law.
- The moral obligation to obey is defined as political obligation.
- Bentham argues that every legal system can and should be represented solely in terms of duty-imposing and duty-excepting laws.
- Law can only be understood in relation to duties.
- A legal right is an interest that warrants holding others under an obligation to protect it, a legal power is the ability to create or modify obligations.
- Legal obligations are legal requirements with which law's subjects are bound to conform.
- the normal function of sanctions in the law is to reinforce duties, not to constitute them.
- HLA Hart - a legal duty is morally valid only if there are sound moral reasons to comply with it.
- Raz - obligations are categorical reasons for action that are also protected by exclusionary reasons not to act on some of the competing reasons to the contrary. Obligations exclude some contrary reasons but they do not normally exclude all: an exclusionary reason is not necessarily a conclusive reason.
