Oppenheimer, P. E., & Zalta, E. N. (2011). A computationally-discovered simplification of the ontological argument. Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 89(2), 333-349.

> The authors investigate the ontological argument computation- ally. The premises and conclusion of the argument are repre- sented in the syntax understood by the automated reasoning engine prover9. Using the logic of definite descriptions, the authors developed a valid representation of the argument that required three non-logical premises. prover9, however, discovered a simpler valid argument for God’s existence from a single non-logical premise. Reducing the argument to one non-logical premise brings the investigation of the soundness of the argument into better focus. Also, the simpler representation of the argument brings out clearly how the ontological argument constitutes an early example of a ‘diagonal ar- gument’ and, moreover, one used to establish a positive conclusion rather than a paradox.

> Recently, however, we decided to investigate that 1991 analysis com- putationally, and represented the 1991 formulation of the argument in the automated reasoning system prover9. (p2)

Computational Implementation

> In what follows, we use typewriter font to indicate formulas that are in prover9 syntax. Our intention was to follow, as closely as possible, the structure of the argument in our 1991 paper, as outlined immediately above, when representing the premises and conclusion in prover9 syntax. (p7)

They faced the challenge of translating logical representation into computer code.

Code logic was external to the paper, although they appear to require a description of the code in the paper http://mally.stanford.edu/cm/ontological-argument/ , http://mally.stanford.edu/cm/ontological-argument/ontological.in

The code clearly needs justification as the epistemic endeavour was to demonstrate that the algorithmic implementation was a high fidelity translation of Ansel's argument.

> We will not here reproduce the proof that prover9 discovered, since proofs in clausal normal form are somewhat difficult to read. We make it available as an output file.  (p15)

> First, we think this analysis shows the value of employing computational techniques in the study of metaphysics. (p16)

Beauty & Pursuation

>  Indeed, if the reader were to analyze which clauses of each premise are used in the prover9 proof, then it would become clear exactly what part of the content of each of the logical and non-logical premises is actually used in the argument.  ... In any case, the computationally-simplified version of the argument reveals that it has a subtle logical beauty. (p17)

Compuational approach leads to a new insight

> Fifth, the new analysis of the argument brings out much more clearly that it deploys diagonal reasoning for a positive conclusion. By contrast, most diagonal arguments in the history of philosophy have been deployed to develop paradoxes (p18)
