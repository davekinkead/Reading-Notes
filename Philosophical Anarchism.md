Philosophical Anarchism 
=======================
AJ Simmons 2001

Philosophical anarchists do not take the illegitimacy of states to entail a strong moral imperative to oppose or eliminate states; rather they typically take state illegitimacy simply to remove any strong moral presumption in favour of obedience to, compliance with, or support for our own or other existing states. p104

*A priori* anarchism maintains that all possible states are morally illegitimate.  *A posteriori* anarchism by contrast, maintains that while existing states are illegitimate, this is not because it is impossible for for there to be a legitimate state. p105

Weak anarchism simply asserts that subjects have no political obligations.  Strong anarchism asserts this and further entails an obligation to oppose or eliminate the state. p107

Subjects have no political obligations to obey the law *because* it is the law, or support institutions or leaders that try to couple their allegiance. p107.

What is distinctive about philosophical anarchism is that its judgements of state illegitimacy does not translate into any immediate requirements to oppose the state. p109.

Philosophical anarchists must reject the view of obligations and rights as final moral reasons and accept some version of the balance of reasons approach. p109

The a priori anarchist must not just defend the view that there never has been or will be legitimate states, but also the more dramatic and less plausible claim that such states are not even possible. p109

Only if illegitimacy is then to be a far more inclusive failing in a state than tradition philosophical analyses of legitimacy imply, will it entail a moral obligation to oppose the state. p112

The fact that a state has virtues appropriate to it cannot, by itself, argue for its having special rights over me of for my owing it special obligations. p112

Even if laws of illegitimate states have no moral standing, the conduct required by law is often morally required on independent grounds. p114

That both the anarchist and the defender of state legitimacy find murder, assault and theft morally indefensible in no way suggests that the two theories are indistinguishable. p115

We can still have duties to our fellow citizens qua persons versus our fellow citizens qua citizens. p115

The practical recommendations of philosophical anarchism will converge with those of defenders of state legitimacy whenever legally required conduct is independently required or recommended by moral considerations. p118
