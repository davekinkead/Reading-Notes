# People, Territory, and Legitimacy in Democratic States

Espejo defines the Boundary Problem as "Who are the people who should govern themselves in a democracy?" p466

> "the boundary problem is even deeper than the theorists of both people and territorial rights had acknowledged." p467

She argues that both statist and cosmopolitan arguments "share an important problem: without acknowledging it, they both ultimately delimit the demos by relying on territory" p466

> "both theories ultimately are committed, whether will- ing or not, to seeing people and territory as existing in a tight circular relationship. " p467

> "Both positions displace the unexamined assumption that had caused problems (the people) towards a sec- ond unexamined assumption that now bears the weight of indeterminacy (territory)" p467

Relying on territory to define the people is highly problematic because democratic theory says nothing about territory.

"it turns out that the leading solutions to the boundary problem are incomplete and fall into paradox." p467

Her second argument is that "democratic theory should explicitly ana- lyze territory when dealing with the boundaries of the democratic people" p467

The best approach to solving the BP is to dissolving the circularity of it. p467

Her explaination: ^1 p467

>  Equality requires that all those individuals ruled democratically have a right to participate in creating and transforming the basic institutions that rule them, because otherwise they would not be treated equally. Yet, this commitment is incompatible with a second demo- cratic commitment: popular rule. According to the first commitment, all individuals should be allowed to participate in creating institutions of rule. According to the second, the people is a basic institution of rule. The commitments are incompatible because a democratic decision to create the people generates an infinite regress. Hence, democracy is incoherent. This is the problem of popular indeterminacy.

Most democratic theorists don't view the BP as a problem because they see inclusion derived from non-democratic principle ie equality or liberty.

> "So the key to solving the indeterminacy problem is finding a decision-independent criterion, one which is compatible with democratic principles of equal freedom but not set by a political decision in which the people is entitled to participate, so as to avoid the regress." p468

She demarcates statist views as a bounded demos, and cosmopolitan views as an unbounded demos.

Nationalist/culturalist accounts say that _peoples_ form pre-politically. But there are no clear criteria for national/cultural inclusion so the matter becomes a political one. "But if we need a democratic ruling on this matter, then culture is not decision-independent" p468

Cosompolitans by contrast "addresses the indeterminacy problem by making the people’s boundaries irrelevant in principle." They typcially use the All-Affected Principle but this too results in disagreement and must be answered politically (or universally), making it decision-dependent as well. p468

Even in a universal demos, there are those that would prefer local self-determination. This can only be decided politically (or by imposition).

> "some cannot make a crucial political decision of institutional design on behalf of others without undermining the principle of equality." p469

She distinguishes "the problem of the unit (defining the population from which the citizenry is drawn) with the problem of the demos (establishing a criterion of exclusion from the citizenry" p469

> "“independent” criteria currently available in the literature are not, in fact, decision-independent; they still suffer from the indeterminacy problem." p469

On the cirularity of defining territory and peoples - "the paradox of people and territory.

> "the people [are] to be demarcated in terms of well-defined territory and that their counterpart theories of territorial rights tacitly assume that territories are to be demarcated in terms of well-defined peoples" p473

On paradoxes: 

> "Those paradoxes have the same structure as the one we are discussing: they seem to show that some normative assumptions used to legitimize rule either contradict each other or are incom- patible with reality." p473

They can be dealt with by either asserting, circumventing, solving, or dissolving them.

Assert - "we would conclude that territorial rights are not compatible with liberal democ- racy, and hence we must choose between those two ideals" or "accept that democracy and territorial rights are incompatible, thus accepting that the democratic state is unavoidably illegitimate." p473

Circumvent - "the problems of membership cannot be dealt with democratically, but all other such problems are susceptible to democratic decisions." but "the solution only works when people and territories are in fact stable" p474

Solve - promising but "there is no guarantee that the actual political processes that ground the state are normative." p474

Disolve - "Relax the principle of equality."  If people don't need equal participation, then the demos can be voted on by others. p474

Future avenues: p475

 - Decision independence
 - Rootedness
 - Equality
 - Feasiblity
