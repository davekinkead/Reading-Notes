Goldman examines "the question of justificational dependence in general, laying the ground for decisions about justificational dependence of groups on their members." p11

Some key ideas:

  - _Belief Aggregation Function_ of a group is the outputs of a function that takes profiles of individual members' beliefs as inputs and yields collective beliefs as outputs. p13

  - _Justification Aggregation Function_ is the process of how member beliefs transmit justification to group beliefs. p17

  - _Vertical_ JAF is a JAF that addresses the justification status of a groups beliefs solely in terms of other member-level beliefs. p18

  - _Horizontal_ JAF is a JAF that addresses the justification status of a groups beliefs solely in terms of other group-level beliefs. p18

British Museum example:

> There are 100 guards in the British Museum.  The first 20 believe that a fellow guard Albert will attempt to steal some precious art.  From this, they are justified in believing that _some_ guard will steal some art.  The second 20 believe that fellow guard Barry will attempt to steal some art. They are also justified that _some_ guard will therefore steal some art. And finally a third 20 believe that fellow guard Charlie will steal some art, thereby infering that _some_ guard will steal some art.
>
> So while only 20% of the group believes A, 20% believes B, and 20% believes C, 60% believes S (that some art will be stolen).  S is a justified group belief from one perspective (all who hold that belief are justified) but not another (The group believes S but does not believe A, B, or C).

The problem here is that the horizontal and vertical JAFs conflict.

> We confront, then, something of a dilemma.  The verdict delivered by the horizontal dimension and the verdict delivered by the vertical dimensions conflict with one another.  Such a conflict cannot be tolerated in a satisfactory theory of group justifiedness.  Which dimension should take priority: the horizontal one or the vertical one?

_Process Reliabilism_ is traditionally advanced as an account of individual justification but with only a few tweaks it can be extended to group justifiedness - so that "a belief is justified just in case it is produced by a reliable belief-forming process -- or sequence of processes -- in the psychological history of the agent (Goldman, 1979)" p21

Justification preservation - that "final belief is justified only if it is the product of a succession of conditionally reliable processes each of which operates over justified input beliefs" may need to be relaxed for group belief. p22
