# Reducing Prejudice: A Spatialized Game-Theoretic Model for the Contact Hypothesis

**Grim et al Public Affairs Quarterly 2005**

Models the contact hypothesis of reduced prejudice with computer simulation of a spatialised game-theoretic model.

Hypothesis: According to the contact hypothesis, prejudice against members of one group by members of another will be reduced with increased social contact between members of the groups. p1

Large scale social psychological theories generate practical and ethical obstacles to conducting large-scale controlled tests in which relevant variables can be manipulated.

The minimum requirements of the model are: 

- distinct groups
- behaviours that can distinguish actors and groups
- consequent (dis)advantages of behaviours
- a mechanism to update patterns of behaviours
- conditions of varying contact between groups

Play 200 rounds of prisoner's dilemma with neighbours and adopt the neighbour's strategy if the score is higher.  Tit-for-Tat will eventually form clusters and dominate.

Add prejudice in the form of colour aware Prejudicial Tit for Tat. T-f-T with like colour, defect with other colour.
