# The Justification of Democracy

"By "democracy" I mean that form of community government in which themembers of a community may participate equally in making directive decisions which concern them all." p1

Democracy may be justified and vindicated. Vindication means showing that certain desirable states of affairs are a probable consequent of it. "Justifica tion consists in a demonstration of its rightness, based upon some principle or principles whose truth is evident or universally accepted." 

The "contrast between vindication and justification, then, is one between arguments prospectively and retrospectively oriented."  Vindication is empiric, justification theoretic.

"The vindication and justification of democracy are logically independent of one another ... it is possible to accept one while rejecting the other; " p2

Democracy can be defended generally and with regards to a particular community.

Justifying democracy in general requires showing that: p3

  1. That equals should be treated equally.
  2. That all men are equal in one fundamental respect.
  3. That the respect in which all men are equal is precisely that necessary to justify democracy in the body politic.

"That equals should be treated equally is a basic principle of distributive justice."  This is so widely acknowledges that it can be taken as given or primative.

Determining how to share power is a basic task of distributive justice. So given 1) & 2), justice requires democracy. p5

Inequalities of _concern_ or _standing_ may defeat the demands to equality. p6

To justify democracy in a body politic would require that: p10

  a. that all men are equal in some fundamental respect; and 
  b. that the respect in which all men are equal does justify the equal assignment of the right to participate in the government of the polity.
