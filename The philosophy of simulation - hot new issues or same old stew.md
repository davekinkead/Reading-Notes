# The philosophy of simulation: hot new issues or same old stew?

## Frigg & Reiss 2009

Frigg & Riess examine and reject a number of claims made by proponents regarding the novelty of computer simulations in science.  The claims can be divided into: 

> Metaphysical: Simulations create some kind of parallel world in which experiments can be conducted under more favourable conditions than in the ‘real world’.   
> Epistemic: Simulations demand a new epistemology.  
> Semantic: Simulations demand a new analysis of how models/theories relate to con- crete phenomena.  
> Methodological: Simulating is a Sui Generis activity that lies ‘in between’ theorising and experimentation.  
> (p 595)

Their claims is that while simulations offer something new to science, they don't create anything new for the philosophy of science.

"Simulations increase the range of phenomena that are epistemically accessible to us.." p594

"Computer simulations extend the class of tractable mathematics and thereby broaden the range of modelling tools that we can use." p594

"...computational techniques ‘constitutes a signifi- cant and permanent addition to the methods of science..." p594

"...transform theoretical structures into specific concrete knowledge of physical systems..." p594

"In sum, we agree that simulations introduce something new and exciting into science, but we doubt that this requires us to rewrite the philosophy of science." p595
