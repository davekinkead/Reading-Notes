# The Boundary Problem and the Ideal of Democracy

Erman's paper is a simple conditional: if democracy is a normative ideal, then any solution to the boundary problem must be compatible with the basic conditions of democracy.

She defines the issue as "The problem of who should be included in this collective and thus take part in the collective democratic decision-making, ... is called the boundary problem in democratic theory" p535

Her position is that "the ideal of democracy – ...democracy as collective self-determination (the ‘rule by the people’) is intrinsically justified as the ultimate foundation of legitimate authority" and that "the so-called ‘equal influence principle’ is preferable to solutions drawing on what is commonly called ‘the all affected interests principle’" p535

So "to the extent that we wish to hold on to democracy as a normative ideal when approaching the boundary question about justified inclusion (the ‘B question’), whatever solution we come up with, it must be compatible with the basic conditions of democracy (the ‘C question’, i.e. what conditions must an arrangement fulfil in order to be democratic?)." p535

"On the narrower exogenous view, the boundary problem is considered to be a question to which democratic theory is not supposed to offer an answer" p535

"On the broader endogenous view, by contrast, the boundary question is seen as internal to democratic theory in the sense that answers to this question also rest on democratic theory" p535

> She extends the All Coerced Principle

"The equal influence principle states that ‘all those who are systematically and over time subjected to the exercise of political power (authority) and to its laws, political decisions and rules, should systematically and over time have an equal influence in the decision making’" p536 

> The C question needs to come first vice other theorists.

"Most importantly, from the fact that the B question is causally and empirically prior, it does not follow that it is also normatively prior." p536

"if we adopt the broader endogenous view of democratic theory when approaching the B question, we need a pair of ‘democratic glasses’, specifying at least the basic requirements for an arrangement to qualify as minimally democratic (answering the C question), in order to know where to look" p536

"equal decision power also involves what we might call a ‘teleological’ dimension, in that people rule over themselves only if they, at least a sufficient number of them, act politically by ‘exercising’ their political equality." p536

Democracy requires that people bind themselves equally to each other. p536

"it is not clear how [all-affected-interests] is able to get us from a conception of moral equality in terms of counting all interests equally, to political equality in terms of the equal political power." p536

"Hence, while the all affected principle might be used as a justification of democratic borders as part of a moral theory, e.g. a theory of justice, it is difficult to see how it can translate by itself its moral egalitarian underpinnings into equal political influence." p536

Contexts of interdependent interests: the "circumstances in which the realization of nearly all of the fundamental interests of a person is connected with the realization of nearly all fundamental interests of others" p541

"The condition of interdependent interests on my account does not justify any normative criteria of democratic inclusion – this work is done by the equal influence principle – it only justifies the applicability of democracy as a normative ideal." p541

> interdependent interests place a constraint on over inclusion.  

> The all-affected interest principle may not justify suffrage or inclusion but it does justify consideration.

"In sum, on the defended account, political legitimacy requires the fulfilment of the principle of political legitimacy, which is applicable in contexts of arbitrary rule, while democratic legitimacy requires the fulfilment of the equal influence principle, which is applicable in contexts of interdependent interests" p543


> Erman's argument has very strong parallels with @song2012's but suffers the same objections.

>  - democracy requires equality and equality demands a different prinicple
>  - both however, fail to answer the question of who should be bounded by what
