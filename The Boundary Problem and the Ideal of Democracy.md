# The Boundary Problem and the Ideal of Democracy

"The problem of who should be included in this collective and thus take part in the collective democratic decision-making, ... is called the boundary problem in democratic theory" p535

"On the narrower exogenous view, the boundary problem is con- sidered to be a question to which democratic theory is not supposed to offer an answer" p535

"On the broader endogenous view, by contrast, the boundary question is seen as in- ternal to democratic theory in the sense that answers to this question also rest on democratic theory" p535

"The thesis defended is that the so-called ‘equal influence principle’ is prefer- able to solutions drawing on what is commonly called ‘the all affected interests principle’" p535

"The equal influence principle states that ‘all those who are systematically and over time subjected to the exercise of political power (authority) and to its laws, political decisions and rules, should systematically and over time have an equal influence in the decision-making’" p536 

This is the same as the All Coerced Principle

"Most impor- tantly, from the fact that the B question is causally and empirically prior, it does not follow that it is also nor- matively prior." p536

"if we adopt the broader en- dogenous view of democratic theory when approaching the B question, we need a pair of ‘democratic glasses’, specifying at least the basic requirements for an arrange- ment to qualify as minimally democratic (answering the C question), in order to know where to look" p536


Erman's argument has very strong allegiances with @song2012's but suffers the same objections.

  - all affected principle ignores the conditions of democracy
  - democracy requires equality and equality demands a different prinicple
  - both however, fail to answer the question of who should be bounded by what
