Political Obligation SEP
========================


T. H. Green's Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation was the first instance of the term in 1879.

**Socrates**

Socrates offers 3 justifications: (in Platos Crito)

- tacit consent from residency
- gratitude from receiving benefits from Athens
- fair play - disobedience would mistreat fellow citizens

**Divine Command**

Divine right of kings inspired by St Paul

Romans (13:1–2): “For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.”

**Social Contract**

Hobbes, Locke & Rousseau rely on contract theory to justify obligation.  Hobbes & Locke invoke tacit consent via submission or residence.

**Utilitarianism**

"If one's guiding principle is always to act to maximize expected utility, or promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number, then obligations seem to have little or no binding force"

Sartorius and Hare have made (unsuccessful) attempts to rescue utilitarianism by invoking 'rules of thumbs' or disutility in convention breaking.

**Obligations vs Duties**

Political obligations have moral content.  If they exist, they impose a moral duty to obey.

But they are different in that obligations must be voluntarily undertaken or incurred, but duties need not be.

"A political obligation, if it exists, is a moral duty to obey the law."

**Obligations vs Morality**

Political obligations have been contrasted with morality in 3 ways:

- they are *prima facie* obligations that are morally binding but not absolutely
- they are genuine obligations but not morally binding
- they are not really obligations at all.

(Ignores AJ Simmon's claim obligations/ought distinction)

**Political vs Legal Obligation**

One can be bound to the law but not have political obligations. 
"Legal obligations are specific rather than systemic"


**Anarchist Challenges**

A priori arguments hold that no political obligation to obey the law *can* exist as this violates autonomy

A posteriori arguments hold that no political obligation to obey the law *has* existed.


**Contemporary Accounts**

**Consent**

Objections are that it "is not that consent cannot be a source of obligations, for they typically believe it can. The claim, instead, is that too few people have given the kind of express or actual consent that can ground a general obligation to obey the law, and neither hypothetical nor tacit consent will supply the defect, for reasons already canvassed."

**Gratitude**

1.  The person who benefits from X has an obligation of gratitude not to act contrary to X's interests.
2.  Every citizen has received benefits from the state.
3.  Every citizen has an obligation of gratitude not to act in ways that are contrary to the state's interests.
4.  Noncompliance with the law is contrary to the state's interests.
5.  Every citizen has an obligation of gratitude to comply with the law.

**Fair Play**

Hart "when a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise according to rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to these restrictions when required have a right to a similar submission from those who have benefited by their submission"" (1955, p. 185)

**Membership or Association**

"Voluntary or not, membership entails obligation. Anyone who acknowledges membership in a particular polity must therefore acknowledge that he or she has a general obligation to obey its laws."

**Natural Duty**

One may not have an obligation to obey the law (as obligations require voluntary commitment) but a natural duty of justice requires us to obey the law (assuming the law reflects natural justice)
