> It is often said that ‘every logical truth is obvious’ (Quine 1970: 82), that the ‘axioms and rules of logic are true in an obvious way’ (Murawski 2014: 87), or that ‘logic is a theory of the obvious’ (Sher 1999: 207). In this chapter, I set out to test empirically how the idea that logic is obvious is reflected in the scholarly work of logicians and philosophers of logic. My approach is data-driven. That is to say, I propose that systematically searching for patternsof usage in databases of scholarly works, such as JSTOR, can provide new insights into the ways in which the idea that logic is obvious is reflected in logical and philosophical practice, i.e., in the arguments that logicians and philosophers of logic actually make in their published work.

Uses methods of data science to analyse a large corpus of logical and philosophical texts in order to shed light on logical, philosophical, and metaphilosophical questions.

> I propose to use indicator words to test how the idea that ‘logic is a theory of the obvious’ (Sher 1999: 207) and that ‘logic is [...] necessary and a priori’ (Russell 2015: 793) is reflected in the scholarly work of logicians and philosophers of logic. (p6)

> The data driving this empirical study is taken from JSTOR Data for Research (jstor.org/dfr) (p8)

> To make sure that the aforementioned indicator words occur in the contexts of arguments, to rule out non- argumentative (e.g., rhetorical) instances of ‘obvious’ as much as possible, and to test predictions (A)-(C) above, I have anchored them to the argument indicators ‘therefore’ and ‘follows’ within 10 words of each other (p8)

Statistical analysis was then performed on the data
