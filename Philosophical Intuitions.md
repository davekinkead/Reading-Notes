# Philosophical Intuitions

### Alvin I. Goldman 2007

> One thing that distinguishes philosophical methodology from the meth- odology of the sciences is its extensive and avowed reliance on intuition. p1

> philosophers routinely consider actual and hypothetical examples and ask whether these examples provide instances of the target category or concept.

Our intuitions about whether these possibles are proper instances are then used as evidence for the possibles being proper instances.

> intuitions play a particularly critical role in a certain sector of philo- sophical activity.

Gettier's _discovery_ that knowledge != JTB didn't occur when his article was published but when almost everyone read it and shared his intuitions. (p2)


Others on intuition....

>  Saul Kripke remarks: “Of course, some philosophers think that something’s having intuitive content is very inconclusive evidence in favor of it. I think it is very heavy evidence in favor of anything, myself. I really don’t know, in a way, what more conclusive evidence one can have for anything, ultimately speaking” (1980: 42) p2

> Jaakko Hintikka (1999) traces the philosophical use of “intuition” to Chomsky’s description of linguistics’ methodology.

Skeptics of intuitions are:

>  Robert Cummins (1998), Jonathan Weinberg, Shaun Nichols and Stephen Stich (2001), and Michael Devitt (1994). p3

3 Criticisims of intuitions:

> Garden-variety intuitions are highly fallible. Why should philosophical intuitions be any different? If the latter are highly fallible, however, they shouldn’t be trusted as evidence. 

But there are differences between physical and rational intuitions.

> People often have conflicting intuitions about philosophical cases.

>  The outputs of an instrument, procedure, or method constitute data we can properly treat as evidence only when that instrument, proce- dure, or method has been calibrated (Cummins 1998). Calibration requires corroboration by an independent procedure. p4

But some evidence needs to be basic.  This objection seems to also reject memory as a soure of evidence.

> Frank Jackson (1998) also views classification, or application, intuitions as the central type of philosophical intuition.
