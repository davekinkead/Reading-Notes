> For philosophers to be able to take a computational turn in their field, especially if that field relies heavily on historical material, it is crucial to be able to build high-quality, easily and freely accessible corpora in a sustainable format composed from multi-language, multi-script books from different historical periods. At the moment, corpora matching these needs are virtually non-existent. Within the CLARIN-NL project @PhilosTEI, we have addressed the problem of building this kind of corpora by developing an open-source, web-based, user- friendly workflow from textual images to TEI, based on state-of-the-art open-source OCR software Tesseract, and a multi-language version of TICCL, a powerful OCR post-correction tool. We have demonstrated the utility of the @PhilosTEI tool by applying it to a multilingual, multi-script corpus of important 18th to 20th century European philosophical texts.

> Computational tools and methods have significantly impacted philosophical research (van den Berg et al., 2014; Ess, 2004). Another ontology aiding philosophical research is given by (Grenon and Smith, 2009).

Challenges with copyright

> Importantly, many among these editions are not in open access, so their use within digital phi- losophy projects is severely limited. This applies to e.g. commercial electronic editions, and to the content provided by the TLG. (p381)
