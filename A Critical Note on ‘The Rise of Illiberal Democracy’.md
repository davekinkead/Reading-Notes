# A Critical Note on ‘The Rise of Illiberal Democracy’

Zakaria argues that "Democracy is flourishing; constitutional liberalism is not" and later "Far from being a temporary or transitional stage, it appears that many countries are settling onto a form of government that mixes a substantial degree of democracy with a substantial degree of illiberalism"

Zakaria does this by combining Freedom House's Survey data on political rights and civil liberties into a single metric. But a single dimension cannot capture the full topography of a two axis conception.

Møller then re-analyses the Freedom House data using a Political Rights v Civil Liberties topography.

## Results

During the period 1990 to 2005, the percentage of states that were liberal democracies grew from 30% to 41%.

Illiberal democracies (numbering only 7-26 states) fluctuated between 33% and 8% of all democracies, with a gradual downward trend after 2000.

"The bivariate correlation between ‘political rights’ and ‘civil liberties’ in 2005 finds expression in a Pearson’s r of no less than 0.951." p560

Illiberal non-democracies remained steady at 53-59% of all states.
