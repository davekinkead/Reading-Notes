# Models of segregation

## Thomas Schelling 1969

Schelling's paper is about the segregation that can result form discriminatory individual choices. p488  The only requirement of the model is that the distinctions between agents be twofold, exhaustive and recognisable. p488  His "conjecture is that the interplay of individual choices, where unorganised segregation is concerned, is a complex system with collective results that bear no close relation to individual intent." p488

Certain logical constraints apply to all systems (p489)

- both groups can't be numerically superior
- only complete segregation works if both groups want to be locally superior
- local majorities are determined by how far the concept of neighbour extends

### The Model

- model agent satisfaction based on how far one's neighbourhood extends
- happiness depends on tolerance ratios being satisfied
- agents move if unhappy
