Tacit Consent and Political Obligation
======================================

**A John Simmons 1976**

Consent Theory
--------------

- "Consent theory has provided us with a more intuitively appealing account of political obligation than any other tradition in modern political theory" p274
- "The heart of this doctrine is the claim that no man is obligated to support or comply with any political power unless he has personally consented to its authority over him"

Defining Consent
---------------

Consent act are:

- deliberate & voluntary
- intentionally & knowingly
- designed to change the structure of rights
- generate obligations on the consenters
- always given to actions of others (as opposed to promises)
- grants authority that the consenter has to the consentee who doesn't
- signalled through an appropriate expressive intention

Silence can be taken for consent when: pp279-280

- The situation must be such that it is perfectly clear that consent is appropriate and that the individual is aware of this.
- There must be a definite period of reasonable duration when objections or expressions of dissent are invited or clearly appropriate, and the acceptable means of expressing this dissent.
- he point at which expressions of dissent are no longer allowable must be made clear in some way to the potential consenter.
- The means acceptable for indicating dissent must be reasonable and reasonably easily performed.
- The consequences of dissent cannot be extremely detrimental to the potential consenter.

Simmons is clearly wrong about the last one - consequences are not the problem but an independent right to impose the costs of non-consent is.


Consent vs Promising
--------------------


- Primary purpose of promising is to undertake an obligation, special rights are secondary.
- Primary purpose of consenting is to authorise the action of others, promise of non-interference are secondary. p276


Necessary & Sufficient
----------------------

- Rawls though consent insufficient for political obligation.
- "acquiescence in, or even consent to, clearly unjust institutions does not give rise to obligations," and that "obligatory ties presuppose just institutions." p277
- Locke thought it necessary but not sufficient.
- Man can consent to bad government but not be bound by it.
- "For a man, not having the power over his own life, cannot, by com- pact, or his own consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put him- self under the absolute, arbitrary power of another"
