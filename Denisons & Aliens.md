Denisons & Aliens
=================

AJ Simmons 2001


**Locke's Position**

-	the only way to lose one's natural liberty is by giving one's own consent to becoming a member of the body politic. 
-	because so few people actually expressly consent to a political authority, tacit consent is required
-	tacit consent is given by enjoying the benefits of authority, including residence.

**Problems**

-	tacit consent generates the same kinds of obligations as express consent
-	but both residents and aliens give tacit consent by enjoying the benefits of authority.
-	so why aren't aliens members of the body politic?
