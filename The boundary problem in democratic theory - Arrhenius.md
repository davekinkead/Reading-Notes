# The boundary problem in democratic theory

The boundary problem is defined as "Who should be eligible to take part in which decision-making processes?" p1  It is a "fundamental issue in democratic theory" p1 but it is "perhaps not equally clear that the boundary problem raises problem regarding the justification and legitimacy of democracy." p2

His position is that "if we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." p14

He highlights a number of related questions: p3

  - "how we should decide the relevant political competence for membership in the political community?"

  - "who should have a right to run for office?"

  - "Another boundary problem concerns beings that lack the capacity to take part in the democratic process but who are going to be affected by policies adopted and that could be represented by proxies, for example minors and future generations"

The argument:

  - There's a difference between a normative ideal and a decision rule
  - A theory can be accepted as a normative ideal but rejected as a decision rule
  - Democracy is one such theory

"Someone who takes democracy as a practical decision method justified by a normative ideal doesn’t hold that democracy is the foundation of legitimate government but that its legitimacy derives from the ideal." p5

"If we take democracy as a practical decision method and again raise the question of who should take part in which decision procedures, it seems clear that this has to be answered by the normative ideal that motivated the choice of democracy in the first place" p7

> So it appears that instrumental accounts of democracy aren't bothered by the regress objection.

"if we see the all affected principle as part of a democratic ideal, then whether or not a decision is democratic, or whether it is more or less democratic, will depend on some conception of “relevantly affected”" p9

When taken as a normative ideal rather than a decision mechanism, the All-Affected Principle overcomes Whelan's objections. p12  Affected Interest could have some causal constraint that suggests a federal structure and objectively optimal jurisdiction boundaries.

Nozick as an interesting counterpoint to the all affected principle

> If four men propose marriage to a woman, her decision about whom ... to marry importantly affects each of the lives of those four persons, her own life, and the lives of any other person wishing to marry one of these four men, and so on. Would anyone propose, even limiting the group to include only the primary parties, that all five persons vote to decide whom she shall marry?

He does however acknowledge the all affected principle fits well with democratic conceptions that concern distribution of influence or power e.g. epistemic democracy. p14
