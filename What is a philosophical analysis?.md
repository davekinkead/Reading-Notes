# What is a philosophical analysis?

## Jeff King

In which Jeff provides an account of conceptual analysis without appealing to concepts.  Properties are a different story however...

> It  is  common  for  philosophers to  offer  philosophical accounts  or analyses, as they are  sometimes called, of knowledge, autonomy, representation, (moral)  goodness,  reference,  and  even  modesty. These philosophical analyses raise deep questions. What is it that is being analyzed (i.e. what sorts of things are the objects of analysis)? What sort of thing is the analysis itself (a proposition? sentence?)? Under what  conditions is an analysis correct?  How can  a  correct analysis be informative? How, if at all, does the production of philo- sophical analyses differ from what scientists do? The purpose of the present paper is to provide answers to these questions. p155

> The traditional answers to the first and last of these questions are that concepts are the objects of philosophical analysis and that philosophical analyses differ from the results of scientific investigation in being conceptual analyses. p155

The canonical form of analysis is a universal bicondidtional statement in the form:

    For all x, x is a y iff C(x)

where "‘C(x)’ is some syntactically complex expression containing only the variable ‘x’ free". p156

> Any adequate account of philosophical analysis, in answering the questions raised above, had better provide a solution to the notorious “paradox of analysis”. p156 (see Moore)

The paradox can be stated as such:

    For all x, x is a y iff C(x)

If this is a correct analysis, then `x is a y` “mean the same thing as” or “say the same thing as” or “express the same proposition as” or “make the same statement as” `x is a C(x)`.

But if that is the case, then we can reformulate the analysis as:

    For all x, x is a y iff x is a y

Yet is seems that if the analysis is correct, then it isn't informative.  And if it isn't informative, what's the point of analysis.

## A Framework

> The first element of our framework is the claim that there are properties and relations and that at least some properties and relations are complex and are made up of other properties and relations. p157

> The properties or relations that are combined in a certain way to form the complex property or relation I call the components of the complex property or relation. p157

> sentences (or something like them – see below) are the syntactic input to the rules of semantic interpretation. These rules map the syntactic inputs to structured propositions. The semantics also includes a definition of truth for propositions. p158

> In the first category are words that express (i.e. have as sv’s) complex properties (relations), where to be competent with the word requires that one know the components of the complex property (relation) in question, and how they are combined to form the complex property (relation). p162

> In the second category are words that express complex properties (relations), where competence does not require that one be able to articulate the components of the property in question, but instead requires that one’s usage of the word be guided by the property in the sense that one applies the word to an object iff it possesses the property in question. p163

> The final category is comprised of words such that to be competent requires neither that one be able to articulate the components of the complex property expressed by the word nor that one be able to generally properly apply the word. 163

## A proposed solution

>  Thus prior to, or as part of, the definition of truth for propositions, we must give a definition that associates with a complex entity the property it represents. p166

> We can now characterize an analysis as follows. A proposition of the form of (8) constitutes an (correct) analysis just in case: (i) the property P  is identical to the property represented by the complex entity C (x); and (ii) the constituents of C (x) are components of P.(p167)

> To illustrate, consider the proposition expressed by 
>    (9) For all x, x is a bachelor iff x is an unmarried adult male. 
> Roughly, this proposition is as follows:
>    (9a) [[EVERY: x] [[bachelor x] IFF [unmarried [adult [male  ]]]]]

> Now the entities on the left and right sides of IFF in this proposition are quite distinct.

So, the claim is that rather than expressing 'x means the same as y', analysis expresses 'x has the same properties as y'.

> It should be clear that many analyses intuitively will not be philosophical analyses. p168

> I believe that what makes a proposition a philosophical analysis, as opposed to a “scientific” analysis, has to do with the sort of epistemic relations typical members of the linguistic community bear to the analyzed property. And the epistemic relations typical members of a linguistic community bear to a property are reflected in the stan- dards of linguistic competence the community associates with the word expressing the property in question. p169

> Because I take philosophical analyses to be distinguished from others in virtue of the epistemic relations typical members of a linguistic community bear to the analyzed property, a proposition will be a philosophical analysis only relative to a linguistic community. A proposition P is a philosophical analysis for a linguistic community c iff (i) P is an analysis; and (ii) there is a sentence of the language of c that expresses P and the word that contributes the analyzed property to P is in category 1) or 2) above. p170

!! The requirement for _philosophical_ analysis rather than _mere_ analysis is that the concept is used competently - it has an analytic definition or can be properly extended by the community.

> Because of the triviality of these cases, perhaps the term ‘philo- sophical analysis’ should be reserved for the cases in which the sentence expressing the analysis has a word drawn from category 2) contributing the analyzed property to the analysis ... Only these cases will be both non-trivial or informative and the outcome of philosophical investigation. p170

> Thus one may learn something from such an analysis; it may be informative. p171

While this certainly minimises the scope of philosophical analysis, it does sit nicely with the distinction between science & philosophy being that the former has set of well excepted foundational assumptions.
