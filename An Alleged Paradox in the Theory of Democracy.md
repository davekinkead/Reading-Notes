# An Alleged Paradox in the Theory of Democracy

The problem:

> if a man expresses a choice for A and the machine expresses a choice for B, then the man, if he is to be a sound democrat, seems to be committed to the belief that A ought to be the case and to the belief that B ought to be the case (pp. 78-79, italics in the original).

Goldstick proposes an acknowledged fallacious argument:

1. The majority favors policy P.
2. Therefore, policy P ought to be implemented.
3. Therefore, the majority is right to feel that policy P ought to be implemented.

But he seems to equate democracy with majoritarianism: "Practically no one today will be such an extreme democrat as to say the majority will should always prevail." p184

Once we realise that democracy is not majoritarianism, or that one's preference for A can be secondary to one's preference to accepting the democratic outcome, the paradox evaporates.
