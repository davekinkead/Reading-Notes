> "democratic founding is para- doxical because of the difficulty or even inability of the people to decide democratically on who they are" p382

He describes the logic of Boundary Problem as: 

> "Since democracy means rule by the people, there can be no democracy prior to the delimitation of a people; and since there can be no democracy prior to the delimitation of a people, the delimitation of the people cannot itself be democratically decided, according to this argument." p382

His thesis is "that some people are excluded from the politics of deciding who the people are, is not a logical predicament inherent in all founding decisions." p382

It is only problematic when those "who will be excluded from the political order once founded are not allowed to influence the boundary drawing in the same ways as are they who will be included." p382

> "a political order or community founded through procedures which provide equal participation to people who will live within as well as beyond the political order once founded is not created in any perplexing opposition to the concept of democracy from which the paradox of founding emanated in the first place" p382

> "The founding of political orders or com- munities is democratic if and only if decided in procedures that give equal opportunities of participation to people who will live within as well as beyond the boundaries inherent in the foundation.1 In short, the paradox of founding does not exist in global democracy." p383

Why ideal theory matters:

> "opening one’s eyes to the ignored theoretical possibilities of procedural democracy has significant consequences for thinking about real-world politics." p384


Agné outlines 3 approaches to founding democracies:

  - nationalist
  - contractualist
  - substantivist

The Nationalist doesn't address the issue because relies on a pre-democratic claim to justify the people, which cannot justify democracy. p385

The problem with unanimous consent is:

> "In the vision of social contract theory, the founding of legitimate, or even democratically legitimate, states has been seen to consist in a unanimous vote among the contracting parties" p386

> "adherence to unanimous voting does not address the objec- tion that the group of people who were permitted to participate in the unanimous decision could and perhaps should have been composed in some other way – most importantly that someone who was in fact excluded should actually have been included" p386

> "it is undemocratic to delimit the people through a political process which begins with the exclusion of some people." p387

> "the ideas of voluntary association and unanimous voting do not overcome the founding paradox in democratic theory" p387

Substantivist approaches justify a people with reference to specific outcomes of people forming such as: p388

  - the all affected principle
  - identity
  - maximising autonomy
  - restoring justice

But there will always be disagreement on which substantive principle.

> "a convincing solution to the problem of inclusion can, within a pluralist society, make no recourse to a ‘transparent objectivity of ultimate moral insights’" p388

On a global solution:

> "When the boundaries of a state are about to be decided, the first option is to make the decision at a political level that is agreeable to people within and beyond the boundaries about to be decided" p389

> "However, if there is permanent division over who should make the decision, we must identify a political procedure whose democratic legitimacy is safe from objections that the procedure operates on an illegitimate policy of exclusion." p389

If the deciding of territorial divisions is done globally, then the exclusion objection doesn't hold.

> "Humanity is not just another group of human beings. It is all of them together. By defining the founding category as inclusive of the whole world, no one will be excluded." p390

Agné calls this the "global principle of democratic founding" p391

> "usefulness in democratic theory presupposes not only logical possibility but also normative justifiability." p391

He claims the GPDF solves many normative challenges:

> "Non-voluntary exclusion occurs when a state is founded through political procedures that exclude people who want to be included in that procedure." p392

Why should everyone get a say in where borders are draw?

> "other prospective citizens cannot simply reject his or her claim to inclusion. Such a rejection would presuppose, contrary to the situation at hand, that the composition of the citizenry had already been decided." p392

> "A cosmopolitan in Africa who fights for a world state may contest the division of European states into smaller ones because it moves his or her world in the wrong direction. A nationalist in Asia may for inverted reasons contest regional integration in the Americas." p392

But what if some people simply didn't want to cooperate with others, if they preferred a more intimate demos?  Why does the claim of some for forced participation outweigh the claim of others for autonomy?

> "The problem of non-voluntary inclusion arises when some people are part of a state, or a global political order, from which they want to be excluded." p396

Everyone has the right but not the obligation to participate.

> "in a politics of founding, none of the competing positions on what political communities exist or should exist must be privileged by the political procedure itself; otherwise, the procedure would not observe the democratic criterion of neutrality between alternatives" p397

A key claim:

> "Basically, GPDF gives to everyone the right to live under democratic rule but no right to live on a territory cleansed from unwanted people." 

> " It presumes, in my view correctly, that democratic rights (such as freedom of speech and political assembly, equality in political and legal procedures) are not violated by people having to share territory with others they hate." p398

But this clearly precludes a right to self-determination as the identification of a collective self is largely dependent on others.
