CH1

"Men do not wield or submit to sovereignty. They wield or submit to authority or power." (p1)

Originally used to express the idea of final and absolute authority in the political community. (p1)

The state is not society.  At no time has the state been the sole institution in a community

The state is a necessary but not sufficient condition of sovereignty.  A willingness to accept the state by society is also needed. (p18)

---

Growing complexity of the world has coincided with the increasing integration of state and society (p215)

Modern concepts of sovereignty relate to the absolute power of the nation-state and the relative anarchy of the international community. (p216)

Sovereignty is typically thought to be necessary for the existence of the state
