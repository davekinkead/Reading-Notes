# Précis of The Philosophy of Philosophy

## Tim Williamson

> The book defends two claims about philosophy in apparent tension with each other: that philosophical inquiry is much more like other sorts of inquiry than many philosophers have liked to pretend, and that philosophical inquiry can legitimately be pursued by traditional armchair methods.

The challenge is that "armchair philosophizing is legitimate only if it is not an ordinary inquiry into some aspect of the world".

On the Linguistic Turn

> The hope is that if philosophical questions are not really about the world beyond the armchair, we can answer them without leaving the armchair. 

> Thus the mere linguistic or conceptual competence to engage with a philosophical question already makes available a basis for reasoning towards an answer; indeed, philosophical questions might be defined as those that can be answered from such bases.

Yet ...

> Nothing is epistemologically analytic.

> Standardly, sense experience may play an enabling role in a priori knowledge, notably by enabling one to grasp relevant concepts, but must not play an evidential role. However, in the evaluation of modal claims and counterfactual conditionals, sense experience sometimes plays a role that is neither purely enabling nor strictly evidential.

On Thought Experiments

> Another application of the account is to thought experiments. They turn out to be fairly straightforward modal arguments, typically valid ones, with counterfactual conditionals and possibility claims as premises. We assess the premises by the same offline methods as for other claims of the same sort. There is no special mystery about philosophical thought experiments. In particular, there is no need to postulate a special phenomenon of ‘intuition’. We need only judgments, and dispositions to judgment.
