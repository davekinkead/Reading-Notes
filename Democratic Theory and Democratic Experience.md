# Democratic Theory and Democratic Experience

## Robert Dahl 1996

Dahl asks what the foundationalism debate is really about: 

- do democratic systems need foundations in order to function?
- does democratic theory need foundations?
- do democratic systems need a foundation of democratic theory?

To the latter, he argues that the reason we want democratic theory as foundations is that they can help improve our political choices and judgements p338.

    It seems that theories without foundations can be valued but those theories cannot give us the reasons necessary for political obligation...

The people will accept democratic systems as long as things are going smoothly.  Democratic theory is needed to justify the system when things aren't working.  p338
