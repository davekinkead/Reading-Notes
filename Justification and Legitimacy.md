Justification and Legitimacy
============================

AJ Simmons 2001

Simmons argues that there is an important difference between showing that the state is justified and showing it is legitimate.

Justifying something typically involves showing that it is prudently rational, morally acceptable or both. p123

This in turn involves rebutting objections that can be comparative (that it is preferable to other things)or noncomparative (that it is not wrong). p124
