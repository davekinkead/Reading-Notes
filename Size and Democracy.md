Size & Democracy (1973) Dahl & Tufte

What is the nature of the link between size & democracy? Is is logical or a historical accident?

The greeks argued that optimal size was between non-self sufficiency and knowledge of other's character

Rousseau & Montesquieu link political systems to size. Smaller states ought be republics, larger ought be aristocracies, largest monarchies.

Mill required the whole people to participate in the democratic process

Higher densities of populations have higher spillover effects and require greater levels of coordination

Size tends to break the link between autonomy and participation
The same argument holds for system capacity and citizen effectiveness

The term democracy is used to cover too broad an array of systems.  The differences between democratic systems are just as interesting as the similarities.
