# Public Justification

Public justification concerns the coercive power of the state:

- "The idea of public justification is, at its root, an idea about what justifies coercion"

- "the recognition of citizens as free and equal moral persons deserving of respect - requires that coercion be justified for or to others by their own lights, or with - reasons that they could recognize as valid"

- "public justification has “to do with the sort of respect we owe one another in the - political realm — that is, in relationships where the possibility of coercion is - involved” (Larmore 2008, 86)"

- "“political power is always coercive power” (Rawls 2005, 68)"
 
- "public justification concerns the imposition of coercive laws (Quong 2011, 233–250)"

- "as Christopher Eberle puts it, (2002, 54) “the clarion call of justificatory liberalism - is the public justification of coercion”"
 
- "public reason is a narrower notion than public justification...we can arrive at a state - in which some arrangement is publicly justified by non-deliberative, indeed non-- discursive means"


A requirement for the legitimation political order is that it is justified to those subject to it:

- "The great social contract theorists – Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant – all held that for a political order to be legitimate it had to be agreed upon by or justified for each person."

- "All of these theorists concluded therefore that the private judgment of a few could not serve as the basis for legitimacy for a diverse people."

- "On the empirical account, we have public justification for some arrangement when what each party actually believes, desires, and values is effectual in motivating her consent to the implementation of that arrangement."

- "On the normative account, we have public justification for some arrangement when what each party ideally would believe, desire, and value gives her reason to consent to the implementation of that arrangement."

- "The contract theorists concluded that the justification of coercive social arrangements had to respect, at least up to a point, this diversity of judgments and, hence, that it could not be tied, either empirically or normatively, to some one specific set of beliefs, desires, and values."

- "Thus, while public justification was a theme in neo-Hobbesian and neo-Kantian political theory (and later deliberative democratic political theory), it only came to full light in the early 1990s."

- "A coercive law is only justified when each person has a sufficient reason to endorse the law."


## Public Justification Principle

> The Public Justification Principle (PJP): A coercive law L is justified in a public P if and only if each member i of P has sufficient reason(s) Ri to endorse L.

We can analyze PJP in terms of the answers to the following six questions:

- What makes a reason “sufficient”?
- How fine-grained is the specification by L of the conduct which is permitted or prohibited for members of the public?
- What types of justificatory reasons R do we recognize?
- How are the parties to public justificatory arguments idealized?
- What is the scope of the public?
- What are the modalities of public justification? Or: By which process is public justification achieved?

A justificatory reason exists "when the reason is openly justified or when it is “stable in the face of acute and sustained criticism by others and of new information” (Gaus 1996, 31)."

"A core assumption of public reason liberalism is that people's reasons for action and belief can differ substantially."

"We can now see what it means to “endorse” law L. As we have seen, public justification theory has moved away from actual endorsement, where to endorse law L is to accept it through some deliberate act of will."

## Types of Reasons

"The mainstream view within public reason liberalism is that justificatory reasons are public reasons in the sense that they can be shared by all members of the public"

For reasons R to endorse law L...

- the _consensus_ view says individual must accept L for the same R
- the _convergence_ view says individuals can accept L for different Rs as long as the individual rejecting R can see others as justified for accepting R

The market analogy (we all have different reasons for transacting) provides a good initial justification for the convergence view.


### Intelligibility

- Intelligibility: A's reason RA is intelligible to members of the public if and only if members of the public regard RA as justified for A according to A's evaluative standards.

- Intelligibility Requirement: A's reason RA can figure in a justification for (or rejection of) a coercive law L only if it is intelligible to all members of the public.

"reasonable pluralism applies to evaluative standards just as it applies to reasons (Vallier 2011)"

Intelligibility permits differing reasons and evaluative standards.

### Accessibility

"accessibility permits reasons to differ, it requires that they be evaluated as reasons according to evaluative standards that are shared."

- Accessibility: A's reason RA is accessible to the public if and only if all members of the public regard RA as justified for A according to common evaluative standards

- Accessibility Requirement: A's reason RA can figure in a justification for (or rejection of) a coercive law only if RA is accessible to all members of the public.

Accessibility permits differing reasons but the same evaluative standards.


### Shareability

- Shareability: A's reason RA is shareable with the public if and only if members of the public regard RA as justified for each member of the public, including A, according to common standards.

- Shareability Requirement: A's reason RA can figure in a justification for (or rejection of) coercion only if RA is shared with all (suitability idealized) members of the public.

Shareability requires shared evaluative standards and shared evaluative standards.


## Idealisation

"an individual's morally significant reasons may not be the same as the reasons she actually affirms, which are frequently based on poor information, poor reasoning or incoherent beliefs and desires. "

## Modality

- Discursive theories hold public justification is achieved when an agreement has been reached among the relevant class of public discussants,

- Universalizing approaches hold that public justification has been achieved when we have located a set of moral rules or principles that can be seen as reflecting fair and reciprocal relations among persons,

- Bargaining theories hold that public justification is achieved when individual interests are advanced as far as possible,

- Evolutionary theories hold that a coercive principle L is justified for members of a public P when that principle is a stable and evolved equilibrium for P.
