Core argument
-------------

Def: Welfarists - those who entertain a welfarist conception of political economy whereby the primary purpose of the state is to promote human welfare.

Def: Rechtstaat - a political association ordered by noninstrumental rules of law.

P1 - There are two types of rationality: goal rationality and rule rationality.

P1.1 - Goal rationality is characterised by
  F1 More is better than less
  F2 Decreasing marginal returns
  F3 Completeness of comparisons
  F4 Downward sloping demand curves

P1.2 - Rule rationality cannot be reduced to goal rationality. It is not characterised by F1-4

P1.3 - Rule rationality is actually rational.

P2 - It is unreasonable to act on marginally or minimally salient considerations.

P2.1 - There is radical uncertainty in predicting the consequences of government policies designed to promote social goals.

P3 - All Welfare States seek to pursue these goals.

P3.1 - Classical liberals and welfare liberals are both welfarists, they just differ on the means to achieve the same end.

C1 - All Welfare States are unreasonable.

P4 - The Liberal Rechstaat is not irrational.

C2 - We should embrace the Liberal Rehstaat.


Objections
----------

C2  Non-sequitur. Just because LR is not irrational, it doesn't follow that we should embrace it.  What about other rule/rechstaats?

P1.2  Not all goal rationality follows F1-4.  Some rule following does, ie
  F1 More fidelity is better than less fidelity.
  F2 Decreasing marginal returns (once I reach fidelity of salience, more compliance exhibits DMR)
  F3 Completeness of comparison amongst rules and fidelity.
  F4 Downward sloping demand curves for imperfect duties (demand for giving to charity regularly decreases once regular).

P1.3  In order for rule rationality to be rational, the acceptance of a set of rules must be justifiable or else the rule is arbitrary (hence irrational).  Gaus is just delegating the epistemic problem from following rules to choosing rules and P2.1 can be applied to rule choice making it irrational

"Rule following calls on drastically less information than goal pursuit" (p10) very true but rule selection is much more problematic than token goal pursuit.

If we are to accept Gaus' argument against the welfare state, then we must accept it for all states because of the radical uncertainty involved in selecting which rules to apply in the Rechstaat.
