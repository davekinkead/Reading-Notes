# Models of Democracy

### David Held (2006)

## Classical Democracy: Athens

Justification: Citizens should enjoy political equality in order to be free to rule and be ruled in turn

Featured:

- Direct participation in legislature & judiciary
- Assembly of citizens was the sovereign power
- Scope extended to all common affairs of the city
- Multiple methods of selecting officials (voting, sortition, councils)
- No distinctions of privilege between citizens and officials
- Short office terms
- Term limits (except military)
- Payment for public services

Required:

- Small city state
- Economic surplus (dependent on slavery & women performing domestic duties)
- Restrictions on citizenship to promote solidarity
- Military power diffused amongst citizen soldiers

Liberty & equality were linked. Liberty's 2 criteria were:

1. rule & be ruled in turn, 
2. living as one chooses

1) required numeric equality & 2) required equality of power.  Equality was thus the basis of liberty (p17)

"Law is juxtaposed with tyranny, and freedom therefore implies respect for the law" (p15)  There is a difference between law imposed by an autocratic and that which is self-imposed.

Voting was a way of making differences in judgements explicit as well as a decision mechanism (p17)

Citizenship entailed active participation.  Only through civic life could a citizen fulfil his telos (p15)

Political rights in Athens weren't attributes of individuals, they were functions of the role as citizen. (p14)  The freedom provided by the state wasn't to protect individuals from the state, but to allow the citizen to realise his telos. (p26)
