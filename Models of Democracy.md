# Models of Democracy

### David Held (2006)


## Introduction

- Many people and states all proclaim to be democrats but have very different views on what democracy is.
- 'Democracy' is often used to legitimate political structures and authority but this is only a relatively recent phenomenon.
- Democracy is the dominant form of political organisation today but the political structures in many of these states is fragile.

Many definitional problems are associated with democracy:

  - who are the people
  - how should they participate in politics
  - what political, social, & economic conditions are assumed and necessary

"Not only is the history of democracy marked by conflicting interpretations, but also ancient and modern notions intermingle to produce ambiguous and inconsistent accounts of the key terms of democracy" (pX)

"While democratic theory has examined and debated at length the challenges to democracy that emerge from with the boundaries of the nation-state, it has not seriously questions whether the nation-state itself can remain at the centre of democratic thought." (pXI)

"Democracy means a form of government in which ... the people rule. [It] entails a political community in which there is some form of political equality among the people." (p1)

"I believe that it is only when ideas are connected to propitious historical circumstances and structural forces that they develop sufficient influence to alter the nature and workings of institutional forms." p7



## Classical Democracy: Athens

Justification: 

  - Citizens should enjoy political equality in order to be free to rule and be ruled in turn (unity of ruler & ruled)
  - public/political participation was the only way to live honourable and fulfilled.

Featured:

  - Direct participation in legislature & judiciary
  - Assembly of citizens was the sovereign power
  - Scope extended to all common affairs of the city
  - Multiple methods of selecting officials (voting, sortition, councils)
  - No distinctions of privilege between citizens and officials
  - Short office terms
  - Term limits (except military)
  - Payment for public services

Required:

  - Small city state
  - Economic surplus (dependent on slavery & women performing domestic duties)
  - Restrictions on citizenship to promote solidarity
  - Military power diffused amongst citizen soldiers

Liberty & equality were linked. Liberty's 2 criteria were:

1. rule & be ruled in turn, 
2. living as one chooses

1) required numeric equality & 2) required equality of power.  Equality was thus the basis of liberty (p17)

"Law is juxtaposed with tyranny, and freedom therefore implies respect for the law" (p15)  There is a difference between law imposed by an autocratic and that which is self-imposed.

Voting was a way of making differences in judgements explicit as well as a decision mechanism (p17)

Citizenship entailed active participation.  Only through civic life could a citizen fulfil his telos (p15)

Political rights in Athens weren't attributes of individuals, they were functions of the role as citizen. (p14)  The freedom provided by the state wasn't to protect individuals from the state, but to allow the citizen to realise his telos. (p26)


## Protective Republicanism

Freedom required the accountability to no authority but itself. p34

Justification:

  - Political participation is an essential condition of personal liberty; if citizens do not rule themselves, they will be dominated by other. p44\
  - democracy is the instrument to protect oneself from arbitrary rule of others

Features:

  - Balance of power between the demos, aristocracy and the monarchy linked to a mixed  constitution.
  - All leading political forces played an active role in public life
  - Active Citizen participation achieved through a variety of mechanisms
  - Competing social groups competing for and protecting their interests
  - Liberties of speech, expression, and association.
  - Rule of law

Conditions:

  - Small city
  - Religious worship
  - Society with independent artists and traders
  - Exclusion of women and labourers
  - Intensive conflict amongst rival groups

A return to the classical tradition. Rejection of the idea that ruling was a function of divine right. p32

'Democracy' became a pejorative after Aristotle, more associated with the rule of the rabble & interests of the poor at the expense of the common good.  Republican democracy was more like a democratic aristocracy. p33

Republicanism can be distinguished as humanist vs classical: the intrinsic role of participation vs instrumental. p36


## Developmental Republicanism 

Justification (p48)

  - Citizens must enjoy political and economic equality in order that nobody can be master of another and all can enjoy equal freedom and development in the process of self-determination for the common good.
  - democracy has intrinsic value in transforming the character (self expression & development) of citizens

Key Features

  - Division of legislative and executive functions
  - Direct participation of citizens in public meetings to constitute the legislature
  - unanimity on public issues desirable, but majority rule for disagreement
  - executive positions in hands of magistrates and administrators
  - executive appointed either by direct election or lot

General Conditions

  - small, non-industrial community
  - diffusion of ownership of property among many; citizenship determined by property ownership
  - domestic service of women to free men for work and politics


## Liberal Democracies

Increases in bureaucratic competency - centralised administration & organisation - permitted the emergence of _public authority_ and _sovereignty_ - the supreme and indivisible territorial power. p57  This increased the scope & totality of political control of daily life.

Also associated with this period is a religious doctrine that required the submission of judgement to others - priests and nobles.

Held claims that the increasing totality of political power meant that coersion was no longer enough for political control.  Concepts of obligation and reciprocity were needed to have subjects _willingly_ obey which set the scene for limits to absolute power and governmental responsibility. p57

"liberalism sought torestrict the powers ... and define a uniquely private sphere independent of church and state" p 59

The central liberal problem was how to balance the sovereignty of the state with the sovereignty of the people.


## Protective Democracy

Justification (p78)

  - citizens require protection from their rulers and each other
  - laws must exists to promote policies commensurate with citizen's interests

Key Features

  - sovereignty ultimately lies in the people, but is vested in representatives who can legitimately exercise power.
  - regular elections, secret ballot, competition between factions, majority rule, and popular accountability
  - state power to be impersonal and divided amongst the branches of government
  - centrality of the constitution to guarantee freedom from arbitrary treatment and equality before the law
  - separation of state from civil society
  - competing power sections and interest groups.

General Conditions

  - development of a political autonomous civil society
  - private ownership of the means of production
  - competitive market economy
  - patriarchal family
  - primacy of the nation-state


 ## Developmental Democracy

 Justification (p92)

  - participation in political life is necessary both for protection of individual interests as well as the development and promotion of individual capacities

Key Features

  - popular sovereignty with universal suffrage
  - representative government
  - constitutional checks to promote individual rights 
  - clear seperation of the legislature from the bureaucracy 
  - popular involvement in politics and public life through local government & juries

General Conditions

  - an independent civil society
  - competitive market economy
  - private control over the means of production
  - political emancipation of women but domestic subjugation
  - primacy of the nation-state

## Deliberative Democracy

"The story of democracy contains both a celebration of the end of arbitrary rule and paternalistic politics, and anxiety that democracy could mean rule by the rabble." p231

Within democratic thinking, a clear distinction exists between those who value participation for its self realisation role, and those who value it for instrumental purposes.  Between protection and actualisation.

Definition:

- a political approach focused on improving the quality of democratic participation. p232
- public deliberation is the core of legitimate political decision making and self governance. p237

Again this distinction between democracy as a reflective process and democracy as a transformative one. Is democracy the zero sum aggregation of individual wills or some synergistic whole-is-greater-than-the-parts production of something more. (p232)

Enlighten political judgment is one that is: (p232)

- fact-regarding
- future-regarding
- other-regarding

Deliberation can be the source of political legitimacy - something that doesn't exist before a body politic is formed. p233

Fishkin on contemporary democracy: "a forced choice between politically equal but relatively incompetent masses and politically unequal but relatively more competent elites" p234

A confusion exists between behaviour and justifications that are appropriate for the market place and those appropriate for the forum.  Liberal democracy only recognises private views and interests . p236

Increasing the level of political participation alone does not address the issue of the quality of participation. p236

Deliberation overcomes the limitations of aggregation by (p237-8)

- sharing information and pooling knowledge can transform individual understanding
- reveal how preference formation is linked to sectional interest
- replace the language of interest with the language of reason
