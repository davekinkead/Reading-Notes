# Models of Democracy

### David Held (2006)

## Classical Democracy: Athens

Justification: Citizens should enjoy political equality in order to be free to rule and be ruled in turn

Featured:

- Direct participation in legislature & judiciary
- Assembly of citizens was the sovereign power
- Scope extended to all common affairs of the city
- Multiple methods of selecting officials (voting, sortition, councils)
- No distinctions of privilege between citizens and officials
- Short office terms
- Term limits (except military)
- Payment for public services

Required:

- Small city state
- Economic surplus (dependent on slavery & women performing domestic duties)
- Restrictions on citizenship to promote solidarity
- Military power diffused amongst citizen soldiers

Liberty & equality were linked. Liberty's 2 criteria were:

1. rule & be ruled in turn, 
2. living as one chooses

1) required numeric equality & 2) required equality of power.  Equality was thus the basis of liberty (p17)

"Law is juxtaposed with tyranny, and freedom therefore implies respect for the law" (p15)  There is a difference between law imposed by an autocratic and that which is self-imposed.

Voting was a way of making differences in judgements explicit as well as a decision mechanism (p17)

Citizenship entailed active participation.  Only through civic life could a citizen fulfil his telos (p15)

Political rights in Athens weren't attributes of individuals, they were functions of the role as citizen. (p14)  The freedom provided by the state wasn't to protect individuals from the state, but to allow the citizen to realise his telos. (p26)

## Renaissance Republicanism

Freedom required the accountability to no authority but itself. p34

Political participation is an essential condition of personal liberty; if citizens do not rule themselves, they will be dominated by other. p44

Features:

- Balance of power between the demos, aristocracy and the monarchy linked to a mixed constitution.
- All leading political forces played an active role in public life
- Active Citizen participation achieved through a variety of mechanisms
- Competing social groups competing for and protecting their interests
- Liberties of speech, expression, and association.
- Rule of law

Conditions:

- Small city
- Religious worship
- Society with independent artists and traders
- Exclusion of women and labourers
- Intensive conflict amongst rival groups

A return to the classical tradition. Rejection of the idea that ruling was a function of divine right. p32

'Democracy' became a pejorative after Aristotle, more associated with the rule of the rabble & interests of the poor at the expense of the common good.  Republican democracy was more like a democratic aristocracy. p33

Republicanism can be distinguished as humanist vs classical: the intrinsic role of participation vs instrumental. p36
