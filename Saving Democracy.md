O'Leary, K. (2006) Saving Democracy: A Plan for Real Representation in America, Stanford University Press, Stanford.


O'Leary outlines the problems with existent representational democracy in the USA before proposing a addition level of government, the Peoples Assembly, to address those problems.


On Current Problems
-------------------

O'Leary sees most of US representation stemming directly from the founding fathers attempt to protect elite interests against the tyranny of the masses.
"Federalists designed a system to safeguard the interests of the wealthy & powerful at the expense of participation by citizens" (p9)
Madison intentionally designed the system to create and pit factions against each other in order to form civic majorities (p59)

Distance from voter to representative (1:650,000 in congress, 2 per state in the senate) makes government out of touch.  The large resources required to run for office or even be heard means democracy is out of reach for the great majority.
Representational democracy can only work when the people are equally represented. Distance and access to power thwart that equality.
Elections are not egalitarian because they don't provide everyone seeking office with equal chance of success. (p118)
The role of the citizen has been reduced to that of a spectator (p160)


On Differing Conceptions of Democracy
-------------------------------------

O'Leary clearly favours a republican conception of democracy, contrasting it strong against the proceduralist / liberal concept.
"Its not hard to hold elections but very difficult to make democracy meaningful" (p16)
Publics, groups engaged with one another, are the sole of democracies (p161)
Single peak preferences are much more likely to occur when debate covers a single dimension (p126)
Public opinion is the reflection of elite debate (p24)
Constant citizen vigilance is unnecessary.  It only takes 5% of interest citizens to sound the alarm on bad policy
Tocqueville on USA democracy " self interest properly understood...no objection to my pursuing self interest but they do all they can to prove its in each man's interest to do good"
"Elections were not sufficient to render elites responsive and accountable" A minimalist conception of democracy: a defence.


On Direct Democracy

He sees direct democracy as an impossible utopia primarily because he takes a large & complex state for granted.

"Direct democracy can only be a romantic reaction against the modern nation state & the reality of great size and complexity" (p21)
"Mass direct democracy is anaemic" (p32)
