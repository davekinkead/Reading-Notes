# The Federalist #10

The primary virtue of a well designed union is limiting the destructive forces of factions.  Popular governments are undermined by "instability, injustice, and confusion".  Factional infighting and the pursuit of power works against the public good.

Factional problems can be cured by either removing their causes or controlling their effects.  Removing the causes can be achieved by either "destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence" or "by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests."

"Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires" but abolishing liberty is a cure worse than the disease.  Attempting to make everyone the same is impractical folly given the diversity of society. 

"But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property."  Inequality exacerbates the plurality of human interests.  "The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man".

Personal interest makes impartial judgement by an effected party impossible.  And all questions of political are questions that affect parties.

If a faction is in the minority, then the republican model (majoritarianism) can over come it. If in the majority, then the rights of others will be trampled.  "To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed."

Only two solutions are possible: collective interests in the majority must be prevented, or must be made unable to repress the minority.

"Hence it is that such [pure direct] democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths."

"Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions."

The key differences between democracy [direct] and a republic [representative democracy]: "first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended."

Representation can either temper & refine factional demands or corrupt them further.  Larger republics increase the pool of good representatives, and increase the number of votes needed to be elected.  But this also decreases the connection representatives have with their constituents.  Larger republics are also more diverse, meaning majority factions are less likely.

This logic also applies in federal systems, limiting factional contagion from individual states.
