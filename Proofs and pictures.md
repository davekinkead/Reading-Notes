> Everyone appreciates a clever mathematical picture, but the prevailing attitude is one of scepticism: diagrams, illustrations, and pictures prove nothing; they are psychologically important and heunstically useful, but only a traditional verbal/symbolic proof provides genuine evidence for a purported theorem. Like some other recent writers (Barwise and Etchemendy [1991]; Shin [1994]; and Giaquinto [1994]) I take a different view and argue, from historical considerations and some striking examples, for a positive evidential role for pictures in mathematics. (p161)

>  a diagram is just a special case and so can't establish a general theorem.

> Though not universal, the prevailing attitude is that pictures are really no more than heuristic devices; they are psychologically suggestive, and peda- gogically important, but they prove nothing.

The general view:

> On this view only proofs give us mathematical knowledge; moreover, proofs are derivations; they are verbal/symbolic entities. Pictures, on the other hand, are psychologically useful, often suggestive, and sometimes downright charming—but they do not provide evidence. (p162)

On Bolzano's 'Purely Analytic Proof'

> We have a continuous line running from below to above x-axis [see diagram]. Clearly, it must cross that axis in doing so. Thus understood, it is indeed a 'trivial' and 'obvious' truth.  (p163)

The fallability of analytic proofs:

> Moreover, proofs are almost never given in full; they are just sketches which give ample scope for committing some of the well known informal fallacies. (p165)

> The verbal/symbolic proof may well explain the theorem, but the picture explains it, too (p165)

Proofs can do one of three things for theorems: (p164-165)

  1. Establish a theorem that was not known to be true as true 
  2. Explain the theorem
  3. Show the theorem confirms the premises of the proof

> Russell, too, expressed the [last] view clearly: 'we tend to believe the premises because we can see that their consequences are true, instead of believing the consequences because we know the premises to be true' (Russell [1907], pp. 273f.) (p165)

> Trying to get along without them [pictures] would be like trying to do theoretical physics without the benefit of experiments to test conjectures. (p165)

> the way the picture works is much like a direct perception; it is not some sort of encoded argument. (p166)

> Let us call any evidence which falls short of an actual traditional proof, 'inductive evidence'. Mathematical achievements may rest entirely on deduc- tive evidence, but mathematical practice is based squarely on the inductive kind. (p167)

> Analytic proofs, after all, are not constructed ex nihilo; they are based on axioms or first principles. But where do these first principles come from? Why do we believe these axioms? (p168)

> Barwise and Etchemendy (who are among the very few sympathetic to the use of pictures in inference) explicitly adopt such a view. They hold that 'a good diagram is isomorphic, or at least homomorphic, to the situation it represents' ([1991], p. 22). (p173)

> Consequently, I claim, some 'pictures' are not really pictures, but rather are windows to Plato's heaven (p174)

Analogies:

> Some with an interest in art and psychology distinguish between a 'pictorial' and a 'symbolic' aspect of a representation (e.g. Arnheim [1969]). (p175)

> Mathematicians look for two things in a proof—evidence and insight. Tradi- tionally, a proof must firmly establish the theorem. That, for just about every- one except Lakatos, is a sine qua non for any proof. But a good proof also helps us to understand what's going on. (p177)

> We simply have to learn how to use them [pictures as proofs], just as we must continue to learn more about microscopes. (p179)
