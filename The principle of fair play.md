The Principle of Fair Play
==========================

AJ Simmons 1979

Simmons' objective is to improve and demonstrate that the Hart/Rawls principle of fair play is sufficient to generate obligations towards voluntary cooperative endeavours, that Nozik's criticisms are unsound, and still that the principle is not fit for generating political obligations towards the state as we know it.

**Rawls' Principle**

For a just and mutually scheme of social cooperation that can only succeed with the participation of most members (i.e. free riding is possible), a person who has accepted the benefits of the scheme is bound by a duty of fair play to do his part in supporting the scheme.

The justice condition means the person is only bound by the scheme if he has been allotted his fair share of benefits. The principle of fair play guarantees that only those who have been fairly treated can be bound. p314

The justice condition also indicates that the scheme need only be fair to him, not all. p315

Only if they willingly accept the benefits of the scheme are they bound to bear the burdens of cooperation, and then only in proportion to the benefits allocated to them. p316

"Consent is a clear ground of obligation. If we are agreed about anything concerning moral requirements, it is that promising and consenting generate them". p318

The benefits from cooperation can be considered either 'open' or 'readily available'.  Open benefits are those that cannot be avoided, even if wanted, without altering one's lifestyle.

Open in this sense seems to refer to benefits that are largely unenclosable (i.e. public goods)
