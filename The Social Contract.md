The Social Contract - JJ Rousseau
=================================

Book I
------

"I shall endeavour always to unite what right sanctions with what is prescribed by interest, in order that justice and utility may in no case be divided." CH0

**CH1 Subject of the First Book** 

Social order is the foundation for all other rights but it doesn't come from nature. It is founded upon conventions.

- "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains."

- "As long as a people is compelled to obey, and obeys, it does well; as soon as it can shake off the yoke, and shakes it off, it does still better; for, regaining its liberty by the same right as took it away, either it is justified in resuming it, or there was no justification for those who took it away."

**CH2 The First Societies**

The most basic society is the family.  Liberty of the children is subjugated only while it is necessary.  Once his own master, the family remains a unit by convention alone.
Man is born free and this society is a result of the nature of man.

- "This common liberty results from the nature of man. His first law is to provide for his own preservation, his first cares are those which he owes to himself; and, as soon as he reaches years of discretion, he is the sole judge of the proper means of preserving himself, and consequently becomes his own master."

- "and all, being born free and equal, alienate their liberty only for their own advantage."

**CH3 The Right of the Strongest**

Denies the right of the strongest.  If the right to rule comes from strength, then that right can be over ruled when someone strong comes along.  Duty to obey is a necessity, not moral choice or obligation and is void when those rules have strength enough to fight for their liberty.

- "THE strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms strength into right, and obedience into duty."

- "To yield to force is an act of necessity, not of will — at the most, an act of prudence. In what sense can it be a duty?"

- "As soon as it is possible to disobey with impunity, disobedience is legitimate; and, the strongest being always in the right, the only thing that matters is to act so as to become the strongest."

**CH4 Slavery**

Convention is the source of all legitimate authority.  Denies slavery by the inability of man to give up moral duty (giving up everything makes indemnity impossible), as well as countering the right of the victor in war.

- "SINCE no man has a natural authority over his fellow, and force creates no right, we must conclude that conventions form the basis of all legitimate authority among men."

- "Before they come to years of discretion, the father can, in their name, lay down conditions for their preservation and well-being, but he cannot give them irrevocably and without conditions: such a gift is contrary to the ends of nature, and exceeds the rights of paternity"

- "To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties …… to remove all liberty from his will is to remove all morality from his acts."

Rousseau's utopian state of nature is evident (and strongly contrasts with Hobbes's state of war of all against all)

- "Men, from the mere fact that, while they are living in their primitive independence, they have no mutual relations stable enough to constitute either the state of peace or the state of war, cannot be naturally enemies."

- "War then is a relation, not between man and man, but between State and State, and individuals are enemies only accidentally, not as men, nor even as citizens,3 but as soldiers; not as members of their country, but as its defenders. Finally, each State can have for enemies only other States, and not men; for between things disparate in nature there can be no real relation."

- "The words slave and right contradict each other, and are mutually exclusive."

**CH5 That we must always go back to a First Convention**

The beginnings of defining 'the people'.  Extrapolates his argument against slavery to that of non-popular sovereignty.

- "Indeed, if there were no prior convention, where, unless the election were unanimous, would be the obligation on the minority to submit to the choice of the majority? How have a hundred men who wish for a master the right to vote on behalf of ten who do not? The law of majority voting is itself something established by convention, and presupposes unanimity, on one occasion at least."

**CH6 The Social Compact**

Rousseau offers an account of voluntary association to improve the lot of all

- "But, as men cannot engender new forces, but only unite and direct existing ones, they have no other means of preserving themselves than the formation, by aggregation, of a sum of forces great enough to overcome the resistance."

- ""The problem is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides the solution."

The key aspect of the social contract is that each man totally alienates their own sovereignty to ensure political equality.  Man can only be free if each gives them self fully to the association equally.  No departure from full subjection and equality can be made lest some then hold more power over others than they hold over themselves.

- "These clauses, properly understood, may be reduced to one — the total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole community; for, in the first place, as each gives himself absolutely, the conditions are the same for all; and, this being so, no one has any interest in making them burdensome to others."

- "for, if the individuals retained certain rights, as there would be no common superior to decide between them and the public, each, being on one point his own judge, would ask to be so on all; the state of nature would thus continue, and the association would necessarily become inoperative or tyrannical."

- "each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has."

- "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and , in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole."

Thus, the general will is formed

- "this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will. "

**CH7 The Sovereign**

The people through the contract become the sovereign.  The sovereign cannot bind itself to anything that infringes upon itself or its original act. The sovereign cannot have any interest contrary to that of its members.

Strangely: the subject needs no protection from the sovereign (it is always what it should be) but the subject is compelled to obey by the whole body.

- "public deliberation, while competent to bind all the subjects to the Sovereign, because of the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded, cannot, for the opposite reason, bind the Sovereign to itself"

- "This means nothing less than he will be forced to be free"

- "Duty and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to give each other help: and the same two men should seek to combine, in their double capacity, all the advantages dependent upon that capacity"

**CH8 The Civil State**

By entering into the social contract, man looses his natural liberty and unlimited right to everything but gains civil liberty and proprietorship of all he possesses.

Distinguishes natural liberty (bounded only by his strength) vs civil liberty (limited by the general will); and possession (ownership by force or first) vs property (founded on positive title)

CH9 - Property rights only exist under a collective association.  By the sovereign rights to all common property (and will all men subjects of the sovereign) then personal ownership is strengthened against brute force and annexation.

3 conditions for the right of first occupier:
- the land must not be inhabited,
- man must only occupy the amount needed for subsistence
- ownership can only be asserted through labour, not mere claim.

##Questions

How does Rousseau's attack on slavery support his claim that only voluntary associations are legitimate? Is it a conclusive disjunction?

What is the relationship between the Sovereign, general will, State, Government, prince and magistrate?

Does the formation of the Sovereign require consensus? How does Rousseau balance his conflicting remarks?

Book II
=======

The Sovereign is Inalienable CH1
--------------------------------

- conflicting interest necessitates society
- mutual interest enables society
- society is tied by the common interest
- the Sovereign is nothing less than the general will
- the Sovereign cannot be removed from the general will

"THE first and most important deduction from the principles we have so far laid down is that the general will alone can direct the State according to the object for which it was instituted, i.e., the common good: for if the clashing of particular interests made the establishment of societies necessary, the agreement of these very interests made it possible."

"The common element in these different interests is what forms the social tie; and, were there no point of agreement between them all, no society could exist. It is solely on the basis of this common interest that every society should be governed."

"I hold then that Sovereignty, being nothing less than the exercise of the general will, can never be alienated, and that the Sovereign, who is no less than a collective being, cannot be represented except by himself: the power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will."


The Sovereign is Indivisible CH2
--------------------------------

- the general will is the will of all
- if the general will was divided, it is no longer general

Rousseau fails to deal with what defines 'a people'.  Why can't there by 2 general wills within a city

"SOVEREIGNTY, for the same reason as makes it inalienable, is indivisible; for will either is, or is not, general;6 it is the will either of the body of the people, or only of a part of it."


Whether the General Will is Fallible CH3
----------------------------------------

- the general will is always correct but the people's deliberations may not be
- the general will is the common interest of the people
- but the will of all is just the sum of individual wills
- the general will can be found when all people have adequate interest and do not form blocks or divisions
- the forming of blocks creates a general will of the block but the blocks will is a particular will in relation to the state
- a majority of voters cannot express the general will because it ignores the will of the minority
 - Does he place too great a requirement on the people?

"IT follows from what has gone before that the general will is always right and tends to the public advantage; but it does not follow that the deliberations of the people are always equally correct."

"If, when the people, being furnished with adequate information, held its deliberations, the citizens had no communication one with another, the grand total of the small differences would always give the general will, and the decision would always be good."

"It is therefore essential, if the general will is to be able to express itself, that there should be no partial society within the State, and that each citizen should think only his own thoughts"

The Limits of the Sovereign Power CH4
-------------------------------------

- If the purpose of the state is the preservation of the people, it must have power over all.
- By requiring everyone to submit to the common will, no individual can have power over another.
- Man must obey the Sovereign but the Sovereign can only demand what is best for the general will.  
- when applied to particulars, then general will becomes the particular will
- the general will is less about the number of citizens and more about the common interest that binds them as each submits to the system he imposes on others.
- acts of sovereignty are the convention between a body and each of its members.
- if the sovereign is legitimate, then submitting to it is merely submitting to one's own will.
- there is a strong equality & symmetry in his argument.

IF the State is a moral person whose life is in the union of its members, and if the most important of its cares is the care for its own preservation, it must have a universal and compelling force, in order to move and dispose each part as may be most advantageous to the whole.

"The undertakings which bind us to the social bond are obligatory only because they are mutual"

"This proves that equality of rights and the idea of justice which such equality creates originate in the preference each man gives to himself, and accordingly in the very nature of man."

"It should be seen from the foregoing that what makes the will general is less the number of voters than the common interest uniting them; for, under this system, each necessarily submits to the conditions he imposes on others: and this admirable agreement between interest and justice gives to the common deliberations an equitable character which at once vanishes when any particular question is discussed, in the absence of a common interest to unite and identify the ruling of the judge with that of the party."

Implicitly requirement of initial consent

- "When these distinctions have once been admitted, it is seen to be so untrue that there is, in the social contract, any real renunciation on the part of the individuals, that the position in which they find themselves as a result of the contract is really preferable to that in which they were before."


Death CH5
---------

- a citizen must obey the Sovereign even if ordered to die
- Rousseau characterises the death penalty as a contract (but fails to see that know one agrees to it)
"The state has no right to put to death, even for the sake of making an example, anyone whom it can leave alive without danger"


The Law CH6
-----------

- "Justice, to be admitted among us, must be mutual"
- when directed against a particular, the law cannot represent the general will
- the law must be considered enmas and in abstract to represent the general will.
- the law is merely a civil association and the people subject to it ought be its authors

##Legislators CH7

- to eliminate despotism, command over people must be seperated from command over law.
- politics and religion are not common objects but each used to aid the other
- men have called upon divinity to engender docility of the people

##The People CH8/9/10

- "Liberty may be gained but never recovered"
- an optimal size of state exists and is determined by the nature of the people and land
- distance between the citizen and legislator decreases knowledge, loyalty and social bonds (early power distance)
- large states make universal laws difficult, esp with populations.

##Systems of Legislation CH11

- the goal of a political system should be liberty and equality
- equality is characterised as power and wealth distributed such that no man can force or buy another
- the nature of society is towards inequality so we must tend towards maintaining equality.


##The Division of the Laws CH12

Lists 4 types of laws (and conventions):

- political (the state upon itself)
- civil (between citizens)
- criminal (between citizens and the law)
- moral and social conventions



Book III
========

CH1 Government in General
-------------------------

Rousseau sets up his argument for the separation of powers and form of government.  Like all action is a result of will and power, the body politic is is composed of the legislature and the executive.

- "What then is government? An intermediate body set up between the subjects and the Sovereign, to secure their mutual correspondence, charged with the execution of the laws and the maintenance of liberty, both civil and political."

Equality and balance are key themes as he outlines a geometric argument.  As a people grow, their powers over the sovereign and liberties diminish; a more powerful executive is needed to control them; and a more powerful legislature is needed to limit the executive.

- "The government gets from the Sovereign the orders it gives the people, and, for the State to be properly balanced, there must, when everything is reckoned in, be equality between the product or power of the government taken in itself, and the product or power of the citizens, who are on the one hand sovereign and on the other subject."

- "Furthermore, none of these three terms can be altered without the equality being instantly destroyed. If the Sovereign desires to govern, or the magistrate to give laws, or if the subjects refuse to obey, disorder takes the place of regularity, force and will no longer act together, and the State is dissolved and falls into despotism or anarchy"

- "the larger the state, the less the liberty"

- "The government, then, to be good, should be proportionately stronger as the people is more numerous."


CH2. The Constituent Principle in the various Forms of Government
-------------

Rousseau continues his geometric argument.  The power of the executive is fixed to the size of the state; the more populated the executive, the weaker it is.  People tend to act in self-interest; the more populated the executive, the weaker it is.  So the most active form of government is a monarchy.

- "But the total force of the government, being always that of the State, is invariable; so that, the more of this force it expends on its own members, the less it has left to employ on the whole people.  The more numerous the magistrates, therefore, the weaker the government. This principle being fundamental, we must do our best to make it clear."

- "According to the natural order, on the other hand, these different wills become more active in proportion as they are concentrated. Thus, the general will is always the weakest, the corporate will second, and the individual will strongest of all: so that, in the government, each member is first of all himself, then a magistrate, and then a citizen — in an order exactly the reverse of what the social system requires."

- "We can see, for instance, that each magistrate is more active in the body to which he belongs than each citizen in that to which he belongs, and that consequently the particular will has much more influence on the acts of the government than on those of the Sovereign; for each magistrate is almost always charged with some governmental function, while each citizen, taken singly, exercises no function of Sovereignty."


CH3. The Division of Governments
-------------------------------

Rousseau defines various forms of government.  In this context, democracy means direct democracy, aristocracy also includes representational democracy and monarchies include any dictatorships.

- "the Sovereign may commit the charge of the government to the whole people or to the majority of the people, so that more citizens are magistrates than are mere private individuals. This form of government is called democracy."

- "Or it may restrict the government to a small number, so that there are more private citizens than magistrates; and this is named aristocracy."

- "it may concentrate the whole government in the hands of a single magistrate from whom all others hold their power. This third form is the most usual, and is called monarchy"

- "If, in the different States, the number of supreme magistrates should be in inverse ratio to the number of citizens, it follows that, generally, democratic government suits small States, aristocratic government those of middle size, and monarchy great ones."


CH4. Democracy
--------------

Rousseau rallies against direct democracy as it would mix particular concerns with general ones. 

- "It is not good for him who makes the laws to execute them, or for the body of the people to turn its attention away from a general standpoint and devote it to particular objects. Nothing is more dangerous than the influence of private interests in public affairs, and the abuse of the laws by the government is a less evil than the corruption of the legislator, which is the inevitable sequel to a particular standpoint."

- "It is against the natural order for the many to govern and the few to be governed. It is unimaginable that the people should remain continually assembled to devote their time to public affairs, and it is clear that they cannot set up commissions for that purpose without the form of administration being changed."

- "there is no government so subject to civil wars and intestine agitations as democratic or popular government, because there is none which has so strong and continual a tendency to change to another form, or which demands more vigilance and courage for its maintenance as it is."


CH5. Aristocracy
----------------

Any group ruled by a few can be called an aristocracy.  Rousseau clearly views representative democracy as the best form of government

- "There are then three sorts of aristocracy — natural, elective and hereditary. The first is only for simple peoples; the third is the worst of all governments; the second is the best, and is aristocracy properly so called."

- "Besides the advantage that lies in the distinction between the two powers, it presents that of its members being chosen; for, in popular government, all the citizens are born magistrates; but here magistracy is confined to a few, who become such only by election.22 By this means uprightness, understanding, experience and all other claims to pre-eminence and public esteem become so many further guarantees of wise government.

- Moreover, assemblies are more easily held, affairs better discussed and carried out with more order and diligence, and the credit of the State is better sustained abroad by venerable senators than by a multitude that is unknown or despised.

- In a word, it is the best and most natural arrangement that the wisest should govern the many, when it is assured that they will govern for its profit, and not for their own. There is no need to multiply instruments, or get twenty thousand men to do what a hundred picked men can do even better. But it must not be forgotten that corporate interest here begins to direct the public power less under the regulation of the general will, and that a further inevitable propensity takes away from the laws part of the executive power."


CH6. Monarchy
-------------

Monarchies are inferior because they encourage subjugation of the people and prevent the best for rising up and fulfilling higher positions.

- "The best kings desire to be in a position to be wicked, if they please, without forfeiting their mastery: political sermonisers may tell them to their hearts' content that, the people's strength being their own, their first interest is that the people should be prosperous, numerous and formidable; they are well aware that this is untrue. Their first personal interest is that the people should be weak, wretched, and unable to resist them. I admit that, provided the subjects remained always in submission, the prince's interest would indeed be that it should be powerful, in order that its power, being his own, might make him formidable to his neighbours; but, this interest being merely secondary and subordinate, and strength being incompatible with submission, princes naturally give the preference always to the principle that is more to their immediate advantage."

- "while in monarchies those who rise to the top are most often merely petty blunderers, petty swindlers, and petty intriguers, whose petty talents cause them to get into the highest positions at Court, but, as soon as they have got there, serve only to make their ineptitude clear to the public."


CH9. The Marks of a Good Government
-----------------------------------

Rousseau argues that "What is absolutely the best form of government?" can't be answered but that "Are the people governed well?" can be.  Yet there is little agreement about what constitutes 'well governed'.  His metric is simply population growth.

- "What is the end of political association? The preservation and prosperity of its members. And what is the surest mark of their preservation and prosperity?"
