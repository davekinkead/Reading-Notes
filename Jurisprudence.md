## CH1 British Legal Positivism

The most influential theory in common law traditions. p21

British legal positivists regard law as social fact. p 21

Its typical characteristics are: pp 21-22

- Law is the creation of human agents
- Law as it is can be distinguished from law as it ought be
- There are good reasons for making this distinction
- Law can be identified by some formal criteria
- There is no _necessary_ connection between law and morality

Positivism can also be considered as a method of enquiry - it is empiric p 22

The (legal rather than scientific) law tells us what we can & can't do. It is normative law. p25

Legal positivism attributes the title 'law' only to those rules or customs that are derived from a law making authority as a political or social fact. p25

Hart argued that "developed national legal systems generally display a set of secondary rules that regulate the recognition of primary obligation rules, their modification and their application" p25

Legal positivists tend to be proceduralist. Something is law only if it was made in the right way. "legal positivists insist that in each such case morality has legal force only because a competent authority such as a parliament or a court has converted the moral rule into a legal rule" p26

Separation thesis: "moral standards attain legal status only through some form of official promulgation" p27

Positivists differ from legal realists in that the former define law with formal criteria, whilst the latter conceive of law as what it is actually experienced by people. Realists deny that a non-enforced law is actually a law. p28

Modern legal positivists all agree that:

- law exists as social fact; 
- law is the product of human authority; 
- there is no necessary connection between law and morality.

**Hobbes**

Absolutist theories, that the rulers will is law (_voluntas principis_), are about political power not law.  They do not deny customary or natural law are fictitious p p28

Hobbes offers the first theory of law based on sovereign power.  p28
