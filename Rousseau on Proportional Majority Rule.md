# Rousseau on Proportional Majority Rule

> Rousseau held that ideally we ought to be governed by the general will. However, since the general will is often hard to determine, he proposed majority rule as the best practical approximation to government by the general will. More specifically, he proposed proportional majority rule and not simple majority rule. p111

Veto "incapacitates a legislative body and that the less important a measure, the more nearly a simple majority ought to suffice" p112

Proportional majority rule favours the _status quo_. p112

> Condorcet's theorem assumes that the probabilities that voters are right are greater than 1/2, equal, and independent. The crucial assumption is that the probabilities are greater than i/2. The other two assumptions are stipulated for mathematical convenience and need only hold approximately. p118

> n fact,Rousseau thinks that when civic spirit prevails,votersare able to discernthegeneralwilleasily(SC, bk. 4, chap.I).

> Second,Rousseauwas a populist and believed that ordinary citizens are as able as any to discernthe general-will(SC, bk. 4, chap. i). Where he laments the rarityof capable legislators(SC, bk. z, chap. 7), he means peoplewitha talentfordraftingood laws.
