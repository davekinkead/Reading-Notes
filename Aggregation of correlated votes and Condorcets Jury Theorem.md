# Aggregation of correlated votes and Condorcet’s Jury Theorem

### Serguei Kaniovski 2010


"In its classic version the theorem rests on the following four assumptions: (a) the jury decides between two alternatives by voting under simple majority rule, (b) each juror has a more than an even probability of being correct (competence), (c) these probabilities are equal for all jurors (homogeneity), and (d) each juror votes independently." p454
