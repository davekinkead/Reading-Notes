# The significance of public deliberation


The epistemic value of deliberative democacy ...

> It is likely to be more sensitive to and understanding of the interests of a broader portion of the population than one where citizens do not have the opportunity to express and discuss their interests.. Its decisions will be informed by a better knowledge of the facts that are important to the realization of the aims of the society, since a wide variety of people and groups have the opportunity to examine the facts and test each others’ views on these matters ...  The more fallacious and superstitious forms of reasoning about these matters will generally be undermined. In short, the process of public delib- eration will serve as a kind of altering device, taking out the egre- gious forms of ignorance regarding interests and justice. p248

Quoting Mill

> only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind.  [Mill, On Liberty, p. 108. See Philip Kitcher, “The Division of Cognitive Labor,” Journal of Philosophy (January 1990), pp. 5–22, for an epistemic defense of diversity in scientiac theorizing.]

Deliberation requires diffusion of power

> The power-checking and signaling functions of voting are greatly enhanced when they are coupled with public deliberation among equals in a society. p250

> Moreover, the function of public deliberation cannot be realized without voting power being distributed widely. First, a logical point: one does not deliberate unless one is making a choice, and we do not deliberate unless each one of us participates in making the choice. p251

> The cognitive conditions of decision making are those conditions that enable a person to understand better what is at issue in a decision as well as better to discern the right decision. p253
