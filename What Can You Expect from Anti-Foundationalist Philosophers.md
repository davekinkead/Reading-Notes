# What Can You Expect from Anti-Foundationalist Philosophers?: A Reply to Lynn Baker

A good prophet thinks of herself __just__ as someone who has a better idea.  A bad prophet is someone who thinks of herself as representing something more than other voices .p719

Truth is necessarily linked to power because statements which count as truth candidates are determined by the vocabulary of the victors. p723

Unlike deconstruction, pragmatists can't hypnotise themselves into thinking that by reciting jargon they are changing the world. p725

Effective pragmatists supply a bit of informed irony about the ever-renewed hope for authority. p727
