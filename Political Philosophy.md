# Political Philosophy

## AJ Simmons 2008

An introduction to the key issues in political philosophy.  "The principle subject matter of political philosophy can accordingly be said to be _de jure_ political societies." p2

Political Philosophy is concerned with two key problems: "the proper distribution by political societies of basic social goods [the problem of justice] and that of the conditions of the rightful possession of political power or authority. [the problem of authority]" p9

## Justification

Justification can be thought of as permissibility and optimality.  "We can say that a form of social life is justified it is (at least) morally permissible and prudentially rational (in these senses) for us to create and/or sustain it." p16

There is also a distinction between being obliged or permitted to form a society or merely to sustain it.

_Sovereignty_ "is usually understood to be the property of being the final authority and sole source of binding law within its territory and of being independent of any external authorities." p17

The _State of Nature_ "can mean simply any condition in which people live together without political society." p19  Even compared to desirable states, the state of nature might still be preferable for certain groups - Quakers, mountain men, pacific islanders.

"Nobody but Hobbes has seriously argued that life in any kind of state is preferable to the state of nature." p19

So to justify a state is to show that it is preferable to the state of nature on either moral or prudential grounds and not condemnable on either. p20

_Political Obligations_ normally understood, are the general moral requirements for nearly all citizens to obey nearly all the laws of modern states. p39


"If one provides a defence of the general requirements of political obligations, it seems necessary to provide as well an account of the limits of these obligations." p40

_False consciousness_ is the phenomenon where people feel obligated when in fact they aren't. p41

The two issues - the general _justification_ of political society and its specific _legitimacy_ with respect to use - are distinct. p41

Obligations are distinct from duties for Rawls. Obligations come from voluntary actions, duties from non-voluntary positions.  Simmons uses obligations for both.

The source of obligations can be classed broadly into _political naturalism_ (divine rights of kings etc, might is just), _associative duties_ (special nonvolunary attached to roles, civic friendship), _transactional duties_ (consent or reciprocation), and _natural duty_ (utilitarianism, justice as fairness) pp49-59

"_Legitimacy_ is conformity to rules and principles that confer important rights." p44  The moral standards according to legitimacy are derived the rights those institutions need to act - "the rights to act as they do act" p163
