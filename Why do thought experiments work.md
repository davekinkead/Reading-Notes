# Why do thought experiments work

We...

  - make use of inference mechanisms
  - existing representations
  - general world knowledge
  - make realistic transformations from one set of possibilities to the next
  - identify impossibilities and pinpoint locuses for conceptual reform

TE's are bogus:  Duhem (1914 p202) -> "not only not realized but incapable of being realized"

Koyre (1939) -> their logical force is so compelling that they supplant real experiementation.

They show the synthetic a priori nature of scientific knowledge p430

Kuhn 1964 p263 "Thought experiment is one of the essential analytic tools which are deployed during crises and which then help to promote basic conceptual reform"

They can be reconstructed and replaced by actual experiments later (Norton 1986)

TE are best thought of as a species of mental modelling.  mental simulation is a central aspect of cognition p431

> Running a mental simulation is required for it to be both 'thought' and 'experiment'

# Features p436

They are public and narrative. They take the listner on a dynamic journey of how things would unfold in the real world (even in fanciful scenarios).

They embody specific assumptions. Often these are made explicit and shown to be incompatible.

They are often more compelling than real world experiments

They involve certain abstractions of real world Features
