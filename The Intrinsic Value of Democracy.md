# The Intrinsic Values of Democracy

"Democracy may be prized for its own sake, because it has intrinsic value" although this is not strictly sufficient to justify it. p268

"The essence of democracy is participation...it is self government."

For both individuals and communities, the same principle is being realised - autonomy. (He invokes Kant's metaphysics of moral here)

Autonomy is only a necessary condition however ...  "the fact that the rules are self-imposed gives no guarantee that the members have acted wisely or justly in choosing their rules or applying them."

"Autonomy is not a consequence of democracy" ... it doesn't arise because of democracy. 

Autonomy is important. Compare heteronomous governments ... "The great difference lies in the convictions of the citizens, their attitude towards the law, and in the consequent motivation of their law abiding conduct." p269

Group autonomy recognises personal dignity.  Every member of a hierarchical system except only the apex is functionally subordinate. They become personnel rather than persons. p272

Liberty is a necessary condition for the practice of democracy. Equality is central to its justification, fraternity is a presupposition for any democracy's existence. p273

Fraternity must be given temporal and logical priority. There can be no self government where there is no community. p274
