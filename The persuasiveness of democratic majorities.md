> Under the assumptions of the standard Condorcet Jury Theorem, majority verdicts are virtually certain to be correct if the competence of voters is greater than one-half, and virtually certain to be incorrect if voter competence is less than one-half. But which is the case? Here we turn the Jury Theorem on its head, to provide one way of addressing that question. The same logic implies that, if the outcome saw 60 percent of voters supporting one proposition and 40 percent the other, then average voter competence must either be 0.60 or 0.40. We still have to decide which, but limiting the choice to those two values is a considerable aid in that.

If voter competence is uniform, then:

> In the electoral application, given a large number of independent voters, the proportion of people Vi that votes for a proposition øi will be very near to the probability pi of each person independently voting for øi. Thus, if each person is independently 62 percent likely to vote for øi, then (among a large number of such voters) øi will win something very close to a 62 percent majority of the votes. p132

CJT is a rapidly increasing function (p132)

          N
    PN =  Σ (N!/[N–i]!i!)(pc)i (1–pc)N–i
         i=m

> Thus, among electorates of even just moderate-sized towns, much less large nations, the majority is almost certain to choose the right option, just so long as each voter is independently more than half-likely to be right in a two- option choice (but conversely of course if each voter is less than half-likely to be right). p133

On the symetrical implication of CJT

> The problem is merely in deciding what to make of it — whether to regard it as blessing democratic outcomes or as damning them. In terms of the CJT, that depends purely on whether people on average are better than random, or not, in making political decisions involving matters of fact. p133

>   - Most of the propositions that are put to a vote do not admit of any easy, objective test of truth. The fact that there is a good case to be made on both sides is precisely why we put the issue to a vote in the first place.

>   - Survey research shows that the electorate is woefully ill-informed about most matters of public affairs. 

>   - If, however, voters all cued on the same sources of information, and those sources were misleading, then there might be a ‘common mode failure’ that could well lead voters individually and hence collectively to perform systematically worse than random.

> the question of whether voters are on average better than random is not easily decidable when approached head-on. p133

> The CJT uses the law of large numbers to pass from assumptions about pc (voter competence) to conclusions about Vc (the share of the vote won by the correct outcome). Here we propose to work in the reverse direction, deriving inferences about voter competence (pc) from the actual distributions of votes (Vi).

Assumtions of uniformity

> The CJT typically works with simplifying assumptions of uniform voter competence in two dimensions. First, it is typically assumed that each voter is as competent as each other voter; and second, these discussions typically proceed as if voters were equally competent across all subjects. Neither assumption is strictly necessary. p135

> Voters need not have identical competence; the CJT can be re-proven using the mean competence of voters of varying competence, just so long as the distribution of voter competences is symmetrical around the mean.

> The CJT’s basic conclusion — that democracy is a good truth-tracker — holds just so long as the mean voter is ‘better than random’ on each topic. There is no need for them to be equally competent across all topics.

Voter competence cannot be uniformly distributed.

> From the simple fact that different elections are decided by different margins, it immediately follows that voter competences must differ across different subject matters (insofar as voters vote purely on the basis of perceived truths).

Footnote on the Principle of Charity:

> Some might suppose that, as a sort of extension and generalization of the ‘prin- ciple of charity’, we ought (unless we have some special story to tell about how this case is unusual) ordinarily suppose that our fellow citizens are more likely to be right than wrong, and therefore that the winning outcome is quite probably the correct one. p136

> The ‘principle of charity’ is explicitly appealed to as grounds for trusting the testimony of others, in different fashions, by both C.A.J. Coady, Testimony (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), Ch. 9 and Tyler Burge, ‘Content Preservation’, Philosophical Review 102 (1993): 457–488, p. 487. Note that, however similar in spirit, this cannot be literally the same ‘principle of charity’ as Davidson’s, as shown by Gary Ebbs, ‘Learning from Others’, Nous 36 (2002): 525–549.

Large majorities can indicate lack of independence

> But looking at the proportional breakdown of the vote, and asking ourselves whether that is more plausibly a reflection of voter competence or voter interests and biases, is a useful supplement to the ordinary battery of bias-detectors.


Conclusion

> in the standard CJT we only have to decide whether or not voters on average are more likely to be right than random. If they are, and the other assumptions of the CJT are met, then the verdict of a large electorate is epistemically compelling; if they are not, then their verdict is almost certain to be epistemically in error. p140

> It is an unpleasantly counter-intuitive feature of the CJT, as ordinarily construed, that a 51:49 majority is very, very nearly as likely to be correct as is the majority in a 70:30 landslide, just so long as the electorate is large.
