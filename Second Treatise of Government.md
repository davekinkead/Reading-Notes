Locke - Second Treatise of Civil Government
===========================================

CH1
---

CH2 - Of the State of Nature
----------------------------

The state of nature consists of perfect freedom and political equality.  This is a marked contrast with Hobbes.

"we must consider, what state all men are naturally in, and that is, a state of perfect freedom to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man" §4

Man has liberty but not license.  Natural law is based on reason and teaches that no one ought harm another. **Why?**

We all belong to God, No subordination that allows one to destroy another (self preservation exempted)

Law without enforcement is no law at all.  If anyone has a right to enforce natural law, then equality demands that everyone



CH 8 - On the Beginnings of Political Society
---------------------------------------------

The foundation of political society is consent.  Natural law grants men self ownership, so only they can divest themselves of their liberty, and doing so harms no one.  

- "Men being, as has been said, by nature, all free, equal, and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of another, without his own consent. The only way whereby any one divests himself of his natural liberty, and puts on the bonds of civil society, is by agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community for their comfortable, safe, and peaceable living one amongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a greater security against any, that are not of it." §95

- "And thus that, which begins and actually constitutes any political society, is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society." §99

Political authority stems from consent of the governed:

- "by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation, to every one of that society, to submit to the determination of the majority, and to be concluded by it" §97

Consent to be governed is given by simply being or enjoying the benefits of government:

- "every man, that hath any possessions, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, cloth thereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such enjoyment, as any one under it" §119

- "Nothing can make any man so, but his actually entering into it by positive engagement, and express promise and compact" §122

Government authority covers only lands and those upon them.  

- "whenever the owner, who has given nothing but such a tacit consent to the government, will, by donation, sale, or otherwise, quit the said possession, he is at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other common-wealth" §121

Justifies majority rule becomes the determination of political will with a 'greatest force' requirement.  Universal agreement is not practical in groups with diverse opinions or desires: 

- "for that which acts any community, being only the consent of the individuals of it, and it being necessary to that which is one body to move one way; it is necessary the body should move that way whither the greater force carries it, which is the consent of the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue one body, one community, which the consent of every individual that united into it, agreed that it should; and so every one is bound by that consent to be concluded by the majority" §96

- "the variety of opinions, and contrariety of interests, which unavoidably happen in all collections of men, the coming into society upon such terms would … make the mighty Leviathan of a shorter duration, than the feeblest creatures, and not let it outlast the day it was born in" §98

Locke anticipates two objections, but fails to anticipate an objection to consent in being: 

- "First, That there are no instances to be found in story, of a company of men independent, and equal one amongst another, that met together, and in this way began and set up a government.  Secondly, It is impossible of right, that men should do so, because all men being born under government, they are to submit to that, and are not at liberty to begin a new one. " §100


** Questions **

- Locke describes the evolution of political societies from family to monarchy to majoritarian rule §105-110.  When should patriarchal power give way to consent of the governed?

- How does political authority work in Locke's view?  

- Man consents to government (§95) and his possessions and lands become subject to it (§120).  He is free to move elsewhere (§121) but his property remains "perpetually and indispensably" subject (§121).  Doesn't this conflict with the idea of individual property rights?

- Consent is an act of free will and free will requires an ability to do otherwise.  How can consent be given is an agent doesn't have means to move to land 'in vacuis locis'?


CH11 - Of the Extent of the Legislative Power
---------------------------------------------

The purpose of a commonwealth is the promotion of the common good and the extend of legislative power is limited by this.

- "the first and fundamental positive law of all commonwealths is the establishing of the legislative power; as the first and fundamental natural law, which is to govern even the legislative itself, is the preservation of the society, and (as far as will consist with the public good) of every person in it." §134

- "Their power, in the utmost bounds of it, is limited to the public good of the society. It is a power, that hath no other end but preservation, and therefore can never* have a right to destroy, enslave, or designedly to impoverish the subjects." §135

- "These laws also ought to be designed for no other end ultimately, but the good of the people" §142


This is because legislative authority comes from the people and no man can grant a power that he doesn't in the first instance have (and individuals don't have natural law to destroy others).  It would also be irrational to consent to a worse condition than the state of nature.

- "it can be no more than those persons had in a state of nature before they entered into society, and gave up to the community; for no body can transfer to another more power than he has in himself" §135

- "This were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man, or many in combination." §137


Again, Locke stresses that authority is grounded in consent

- "the consent of the society, over whom no body can have a power to make laws, but by their own consent, and by authority received from them" §134


Civil law must be congruent with natural law, and it must operate by standard, written acts rather than arbitrary decision.

- "Thus the law of nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others." §135

- "The legislative, or supreme authority, cannot assume to its self a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decrees, but is bound to dispense justice, and decide the rights of the subject by promulgated standing laws, and known authorized judges" §136

- "And therefore, whatever form the common-wealth is under, the ruling power ought to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions" §137

- "They are to govern by promulgated established laws, not to be varied in particular cases" §142


Government doesn't have a right to confiscate property without majority consent.

- "The supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property without his own consent: for the preservation of property being the end of government, and that for which men enter into society, it necessarily supposes and requires, that the people should have property" §138

- "governments cannot be supported without great charge …… But still it must be with his own consent, i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them" §140

- "They must not raise taxes on the property of the people, without the consent of the people, given by themselves,
or their deputies." §142


CH12 - Of the Legislative, Executive, and Federative Power of the Commonwealth
-------------------------

Justifies the separation of legislative and executive arms of government.  The legislative needs to only form occasionally but the executive must subsist continuously 

- "But because those laws which are constantly to be executed, and whose force is always to continue, may be made in a little time; therefore there is no need, that the legislative should be always in being, not having always business to do." §143

- "But because the laws, that are at once, and in a short time made, have a constant and lasting force, and need a perpetual execution, or an attendance thereunto; therefore it is necessary there should be a power always in being, which should see to the execution of the laws that are made, and remain in force. And thus the legislative and executive power come often to be separated." §144


CH13 - Of the Subordination of the Powers of the Commonwealth
------------

Legislative authority may be recalled whenever it acts contrary to the common good

- "there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative, when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them: for all power given with trust for the attaining an end …… whenever that end is manifestly neglected …… the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it" §149

- "[the people] will always have a right to preserve, what they have not a power to part with" §149

But,

- "the community may be said in this respect to be always the supreme power, but not as considered under any form of government, because this power of the people can never take place till the government be dissolved." §149

Even a monarch's authority still derives from the consent (positive grant) of the commonwealth and is bound by the common good.  His supreme authority is executive, not legislative, and is owed allegiance only when he complies with law

- "But yet it is to be observed, that tho’ oaths of allegiance and fealty are taken to him, it is not to him as supreme legislator, but as supreme executor of the law, ……  allegiance being nothing but an obedience according to law, which when he violates, he has no right to obedience …… and thus he has no will, no power, but that of the law." §151

- "that they have no manner of authority, any of them, beyond what is by positive grant and commission delegated to them, and are all of them accountable to some other power in the common-wealth." §152

Using force unjustly (against the common good) against the people is an act of war

- "The use of force without authority, always puts him that uses it into a state of war, as the aggressor, and renders him liable to be treated accordingly." §155

- "the true remedy of force without authority, is to oppose force to it." §155

Locke now shifts his argument considerably.  From highlighting how monarchy is limited by the common good, he outlines why anyone would consent to monarchy in the first place.

Those who originally consented to the commonwealth could not have seen every eventuality.  It was therefore best to appoint someone who was 'above politics and self-interest' to watch over the commonwealth.  Importantly, he also justifies the executive overriding the legislative.

- "for it not being possible, that the first framers of the government should, by any foresight, be so much masters of future events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and duration to the assemblies of the legislative, in all times to come, that might exactly answer all the exigencies of the commonwealth"  

- "the best remedy could be found for this defect, was to trust this to the prudence of one who was always to be present, and whose business it was to watch over the public good"

- "any delay of their convening might endanger the public; and sometimes too their business might be so great, that the limited time of their sitting might be too short for their work, and rob the public of that benefit which could be had only from their mature deliberation"

- "To what gross absurdities the following of custom, when reason has left it …… when we see the bare name of a town, of which there remains not so much as the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote, or more inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found, sends as many representatives to the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole county numerous in people,"




- "that though the executive power may have the prerogative of convoking and dissolving such conventions of the legislative, yet it is not thereby superior to it." §156



CH19 - Of the Dissolution of Government
---------------------------------------


Government of a society can't exist without a society to govern.  Whenever society is dissolved, it follows that its government is also dissolved.  The most common way this occurs "is the inroad of foreign force making a conquest upon them" §211

Government can also be dissolved without the dissolution of society.  Locke outlines a number of primary ways:

- The overreach of the executive and interference with the legislature (excluding the prerogative) §214
- The executive preventing the legislature form assembling §215
- when the legislature or executive alter their powers contrary to the common good §216
- the delivery of the people to a foreign power §217
- the abandonment of government by the executive §219

Locke also outlines an overriding trigger: because the purpose of civil society is the preservation of property (including life), any governmental action contrary to this dissolves the political authority of the state.

- "whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence." §222

- "Whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavour to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who. have a right to resume their original liberty, and, by the establishment of a new legislative, (such as they shall think fit) provide for their own safety and security, which is the end for which they are in society" §222

Locke repeatedly states people are not obliged to obey tyrannical or illegitimate rule

- "They, who remove, or change the legislative, take away this decisive power, which no body can have, but by the appointment and consent of the people; and so destroying the authority which the people did, and no body else can set up, and introducing a power which the people hath not authorized, they actually introduce a state of war, which is that of force without authority: and thus, by removing the legislative established by the society, (in whose decisions the people acquiesced and united, as to that of their own will) they untie the knot, and expose the people a-new to the state of war" §227

- "The end of government is the good of mankind; and which is best for mankind, that the people should be always exposed to the boundless will of tyranny, or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be opposed, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power, and employ it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the properties of their people?" §229

Locke rejects the idea that the moral authority of the people to overthrow a transgressing government will lead to anarchy.  He offers a number of counterpoints:

- "People are not so easily got out of their old forms as some are apt to suggest" §223

- "Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, and all the slips of human frailty, will be born by the people without mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses … all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, and they cannot but feel what they lie under … they should then rouze themselves, and endeavour to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected" §225

- "this doctrine of a power in the people of providing for their safety a-new, by a new legislative, when their legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their property, is the best fence against rebellion, and the probablest means to hinder it" §226

Questions:

- how does Locke distinguish between consent & common good?
