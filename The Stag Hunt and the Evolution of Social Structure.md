Skryms uses agent based modelling to explore the issue of how a social contract can be formed - "How can you get from the non-cooperative hare hunting equilibrium to the cooperative stag hunting equilibrium".

Over time, there is some low level experimentation with stag hunting. Eventually enough stag hunters interact with each other and a local culture of stag hunting spreads by imitation and reproduction.  Once large enough, the stag hunting culture can be maintained even in hostile environments thanks to signalling.

"In a prisoner's dilemma, there is a conflict between individual rationality and mutual benefit. In the stag hunt, what is rational for one player to choose depends on his beliefs about what the other will choose. Both stag hunting and hare hunting are Nash equilibria." p3

Hare hunting is risk dominant, stag hunting is payoff dominant.

The shadow of the future transforms a prisoner's dilemma into a stag hunt. p6

In numerous games, justice is contagious. An initial patch of strategy extends into larger and larger patches. p25

Interaction of a strategy with similar kinds impacts the performance of neighbours. p29
