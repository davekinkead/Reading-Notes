# Cosmopolitanism and Sovereignty

Thomas Pogge 1992

## Cosmopolitanism


3 elements are shared by all cosmopolitan positions: (p48)

- individualism, the ultimate units of concern are human beings,
- universality, the ultimate unit of concern is directed to all people equally,
- generality, this special status has global force.

Cosmopolitanism can be contrasted as: (p49)

- legal, committed to a concrete political global order,
- moral, all persons stand in moral relations to one another.

The central idea of moral cosmopolitanism is that every human being has global stature as an ultimate unit of moral concern. (p49)

Moral cosmopolitanism can be further divided into: (p50)

- institutional conceptions concerning fundamental principles of justice.
  - directs responsibilities to institutional schemes.
  - impose constraints upon shared practices.
  - responsibility extends to the bounds of institutional affect.
- interactional conceptions concerning fundamental principles of ethics.
  - direct responsibility for the fulfilment of human rights to others (both individuals and groups)
  - impose constraints on conduct.
  - responsibility extends to those we interact with.

If we only accept and institutional conception of human rights, then we need some additional moral conception if we wish to deny that anything goes in a state of nature. (p51)

I have a duty to all not to support unjust institutional schemes, even when institutional schemes only impose duties on other participants. (p51)  Contrast this with libertarianism in which we may ignore harms we do not directly bring about.

"If they are not making reasonable efforts towards institutional reform, the more privileged participants in an institutional scheme in which [harm is imposed on the less privileged] are here seen as cooperating in violation of a negative duty." (p52)

"Once one is a participant in social practices, it may no longer be true that one's negative duties require merely forbearance." (p52)

We are asked to be concerned about human rights violations not simply because they occur but because they are the result of practices of which we are participants. (p52)

The only way this moral obligation can be limited to national boarders is if those boarders are natural, god given or fixed a priori (p53)

We consider the existing global institutional scheme unjust insofar as the pattern of human rights fulfilment it tend to produce is inferior to the patter of its best feasible alternatives would produce. (p54)

The issue of distributive justices is no longer about how to distribute a pool of resources, but rather how to design the economic ground rules which regulate production. (p56)

There is an injustice in our current economic scheme which is wrong for affluent participants to perpetuate.  This is so independent of whether we and the starving are united by some common bond just as murder is wrong irrespective of such considerations. (p56)


Sovereignty
-----------

A is sovereign over B iff: (p57)

1. A is a governmental body or officer ('agency'), and
2. B are persons, and
3. A has unsupervised and irrevocable authority over B
  1. to lay down rules constraining their conduct, or
  2. to judge their compliance with rules, or
  3. to enforce rules against them, or
  4. to act on their behalf vis-a-vis other agencies or persons

A has absolute sovereignty over B off:

1. A is sovereign over B, 
2. no other agency has any authority over A or over B which is not supervised and revokable by A.

National governments dominate control of decision making in smaller political units as well as supranational ones. (p58)

"It is states and only states that merit different colours on the map" (p58)

A world state is simply the preeminent idea of the nation-state.  Rather, Pogge proposes that government authority be widely dispersed in the vertical dimension. (p58)

Objections to dispersion of sovereignty can be divided into 2: (p59)

1. Sovereignty cannot be divided at all.  Because no mechanism cannot settle disputes about its own interpretation, some juridical state is required.
2. Sovereignty cannot be divided vertically.  Because certain core governmental functions are indivisible.  

Pogge dismisses the first objection with empiric fact "which shows what cannot work in theory works quite well in practice."  Law-governed coexistence is possible between and within states without a sovereign and unconstrained agency. (p59)

The second objection is met by claiming no such core function can be identified, whilst giving examples of core functions performed at varying levels of jurisdiction (federation and EU) (p60) and arguing that often local sovereignty has greater moral grounds, even in cases of immigration (p61)

There are 4 reasons favouring vertical dispersal of sovereignty: (p61-63)

- Peace and security.  The system of nation-states encourages interstate competition.  It isn't feasible to eliminate national control of WMDs through a program of voluntary cooperation.  Disarmament would likely gain the support of the majority if it increases security for all on fair terms to all.
- Reducing oppression.  Vertical dispersion makes abuses and despotism less likely.
- Economic justice. Global solutions to economic justice are more likely to be found when national interest is not at work. "War and oppression result from the contest of power from and within political units"
- Ecology.  Voluntary treaties make environmental externalities difficult to contain.

###Affected Interests

"Persons have a right to an institutional order under which those significantly and legitimately affected by a political decision have roughly equal opportunity to influence the making of this decision." (p64)

Pogge's position that political participation is a human rights is at odds with the (incorrect) claim that what matters is that political decisions are correct. The use of experts is good but "should be done, however, by the people delegating, or abstaining from such decisions." (p64)

The confluence of Pogge's claims are a simultaneous call for centralisation and decentralisation: (p65)

- Centralisation insofar as avoiding excluding persons from the making of decisions that significantly affect them.  
- Decentralisation insofar as those affected by issues are most likely be knowledgeable of them.

A person should be left free to decide for themselves to what extend to engage in such exchanges. (p65)

"The only practical and morally acceptable way of delimiting those who are capable of such judgements is by rough geographical criteria." (p65)

Human beings cannot avoid influencing one another; through direct contact and through their impact upon the natural works in which they coexist.

Developments of the past few centuries have greatly increased the significance of interdependence in favour of centralisation of power. (p66)

"As more and more persons are affected by certain institutions, more and more persons have a right to a political role in shaping them" (p66)

"The authority to make decisions of some particular kind should rest with the democratic political process of a unit that (i) is as small as possible but still (ii) includes as equals all persons significantly and legitimately affected by decisions of this kind." (p67)

A good deal of weight should to those who actually suffer abridgements in democratic processes. (p68)


## Shaping Political Units


Pogge's argument against states having moral claims or considerations (cf Walzer 'Just & Unjust Wars'): "Why do we not also take into account the moral claims of Catholiscism, art, or baseball?" (p74)
