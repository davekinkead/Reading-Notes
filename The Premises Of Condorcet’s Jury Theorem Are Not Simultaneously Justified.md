# The Premises Of Condorcet’s Jury Theorem Are Not Simultaneously Justified

> Condorcet’s famous jury theorem reaches an optimistic conclusion on the correctness of majority decisions, based on two controversial premises about voters: they are competent and vote independently, in a technical sense. I carefully analyse these premises and show that: (i) whether a premise is justified depends on the notion of probability considered and (ii) none of the notions renders both premises simultaneously justified. Under the perhaps most interesting notions, the independence assumption should be weakened. p56

DJT needs to satisfy two conditions: independence and competence.

Franz's Definition of CJT:

> Roughly stated, the classic Condorcet Jury Theorem1 (CJT) asserts that if a group (jury, population, etc.) takes a majority vote between two alternatives of which exactly one is objectively “correct”, and if the voters satisfy two technical conditions, competence and independence, then the probability that the majority picks the correct alternative increases to one (certainty) as the group size tends to infinity.

Central Claim: "unfortunately, in each case exactly one of the premises is not justified." p56

> I accordingly label these versions the fixed-problem CJT and the variable-problem CJT ... In the fixed-problem CJT, competence is the problematic assumption, whereas in the variable-problem CJT, independence is problematic. So the two versions of the CJT, which might have appeared to be just notational variants, are in fact fundamentally distinct.

> What has gone wrong in the argument? To justify the competence assumption, I have appealed to a variable decision problem, one that is picked at random from a class of relevant problems. But to justify the independence assumption, I have fixed (i.e. conditionalised on) the decision problem, with its particular body of evidence, process of group deliberation, and so on. One cannot have it both ways. p57

> I believe that most arguments made in the literature for or against some premise are correct under the author’s notion of uncertainty, and incorrect under other notions.

> I define a decision problem as the task of finding a certain correct alternative x (0 or 1) under certain circumstances c.  p58

> Evidential circumstances are generally observable facts that support the correctness of alternative 0 or 1.

> Non-evidential circumstances are events that carry no information on which alternative is correct but may affect different voters in their voting behaviour, such as room temperature while voting, whether birds are singing

!!!

> knowing whether [average competence] holds for this specific problem might be even harder than knowing the true state x in the first place.  To know whether (Com) holds, one would have to know whether the specific problem involves misleading evidence, which one can hardly know without knowing the true state x. p60

> Importantly, though, an observer – the potential applier of the CJT, interested in whether the majority outcome is correct – can usually not know how easy or misleading the problem is, hence whether the voters are competent, individually or on average. Assessing whether (Com) holds for the specific problem might even be harder than assessing the correct alternative x in the first place. p61
