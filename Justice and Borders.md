Justice and Borders
===================

Miller attempts to explore some questions:

- Is justice then on balance served or denied by the building of walls? 
- Does it matter where the walls are built, who is protected within them and who is excluded? 
- Does it matter whether the walls are easy or hard to climb across?

"When we make a border, we create a space in which certain things happen" p526


Some justice requires borders
-----------------------------

Justice sometimes requires the consistent applications of rules, but the consistency required dependants on the relevance of those rules to certain people.  It is also unfair if someone who benefits from some collective endeavour doesn't contribute.  The boundaries at stake here are boundaries between relevant people.

Nagel argues that justice is something we owe others in virtue of a shared political relation.  For Rawls, boundaries enclose cooperative ventures for mutual advantage.  For Walzer, they surround people committed to sharing, exchanging of dividing goods.


Justice abhors Borders
----------------------

Justice doesn't oppose borders, it opposes arbitrary borders. p528

Quoting Pascal "it is a funny sort of justice whose limits are marked by a river; true on this side of the Pyrenees, false on the other"

"Merely treating all those within the jurisdiction in the same way is not sufficient for justice proper." p528

_Comparative_ justice requires all parties be treated the same. _Non-comparative_ justice requires parties be treated on individual merits.

Our intuitions seem to be strong about what justice forbids than requires.

"So the anti-borders advocate can try to show that the jurisdictional boundaries that we can see around us in the world today do not correspond to the contours of human relationships that are relevant to justice. But that is not the same as showing that the very idea of bounded justice makes no sense." p530


Justice and the Placing of Borders
----------------------------------

"What we are looking at is essentially a triangular relationship between an area of land, an authority that has jurisdiction over that land (makes the laws and the other policies that apply there) and a population who occupy the land and over whom the authority is exercised." p530

Individual claims to property can give rise to collective claims of political obligation.  See Locke, Nozik for accounts of individuals prior to some commonwealth, or property before community.  But this should also allow non contiguous jurisdictions if it is to be based on consent.

Borders could also depend on peoples collective right to property (see Kant, Sidgwick)


Justice and Border Crossings
----------------------------

"Non-comparative justice is widely agreed to include the universal duty to protect human rights" p534

"states have a secondary duty of justice to devise a system that would allow refugees to be distributed fairly between receiving states."

"Comparative principles of justice might, however, apply among those who seek to immigrate to a particular state" p534
