# Public Reason Liberalism

### Gerald Gaus - Work in Progress


"The social contract theories of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant all are based on conviction that the main aim of political philosophy is to identify an agreed-upon public judgment or public reason that allows us to overcome the disunity and conflict that would characterize a condition in which each followed her own private judgment or reasoning about morality and justice." p1

The critical debate in public reason liberalism is between those who attempt to reconcile diversity and insulate disagreement, and those who embrace this diversity as essential to democracy. p2

For Hobbes, private reason undermines social stability, as all beliefs eventually become political.  The social contract gives the sovereign absolute power to decide on issues - to become the embodiment of public reason. p4

Personal disagreements are appealed to the sovereign's arbitration.  "Politics swallows up morality." p5

"In contrast to Hobbes, Locke is clear that a demarcation between religious and civil disputes is both possible and necessary." p6

Locke's liberalism is based on 3 claims: p7

- **Moral disagreement**. When disagreement about morality and justice occurs, a peaceful society requires that these matters be resolved by the public reason of impartial law.

- **Shared reasons**. Resolution of moral disagreements must be based on shared reasons.

- **Insulation**. Disagreement about religion can remain private so long as these do not affect the other claims.

"all public reason accounts are fundamentally at odds with the picture of social life as one composed of fully autonomous moral agents, each independently acting solely on the basis of her own substantive judgment about the demands of justice." p7

The state of nature is simply that where each makes their own moral judgements and doesn't submit to the authority of another.

Liberal toleration (on the Lockean interpretation) doesn't allow religious freedom when it usurps liberal values.  Liberal values must take precedence over religious ones. "That is, only if the private doctrine itself endorses the Insulation Claim is it to be tolerated." p8

On Hobbes & Locke - "A worrisome consequence of this account of public reason is that politics becomes the ultimate arbiter of all moral disputes." p8

Rawls also proposes procedural accounts of solving disagreement but departs by offering an algorithmic rather than political process. p8

Rawls was not trying to tell us what was moral but rather how to solve moral disagreement. To "search for reasonable grounds for reaching agreement rooted in our conception of ourselves and our relation to society" p9

Moral theory concerns the truth of moral claims; moral theory is the search for a moral constitution or way of solving disagreements about moral truths. p9

Hobbes challenges the insulation claim of liberalism: that personal views will undermine public agreement.  Locke fails to adequately justify the insulation claim.  Rawls rectifies this defect -  his Theory of Justice claims that a kind of Nash equilibria would develop where "Acting justly would then be the best reply to others acting justly." p12

The basic tenets of liberalism are "freedom of speech and thought, representative institutions, wide scope for freedom of action and life styles, privacy and the market order, are very widely embraced and embedded in a wide variety of worldviews." p14

Rawls insists that a political conception is not free standing until it is endorsed by a comprehensive one.

Some contradiction: PL requires that we only justify reasons from a public conception, but "citizens have a moral duty in public discourse about matters of basic justice to endorse the insulation of the divergent reasons in their" comprehensive from political conceptions.

"It is, however, very hard not to see Rawls’ political liberalism as an unfinished project; major changes became prominent only in sketchy presentations rather late in the day, and it is hard to conclude that their implications were fully worked out." p16

The Nightmare: unless we restrict the range of reasons relevant to political justification to a small set, A (and so exclude set C), perhaps no version of liberalism can be justified.

Quong and Locke: "liberals just are those who endorse the insulation claim, and liberalism is a doctrine for such people" p18

The "very burdens of judgment that produce disagreement in the former [comprehensive doctrines] leads to pluralism in the latter [political constitutions]." p18

Gaus' solution:

A = the set of all reasons publicly shared  
Ci = the set of all reasons individually held but not in A  

A moral or political constitution is thus publicly justified if for all i who are members of the public, {A, Ci} endorses it.  p19

Rawls & Quong object because this could lead to "those with “unjust” and “illiberal” views would be able to veto liberal principles, either leaving us with a publicly justifed illiberal con- stitution, or no justifed constitution at all" p19

But the veto objection requires that people value no rule over a less preferred one.  "Liberalism broadly construed simply is the historically generated solution to the problem of how people who deeply disagree about almost everything can share a system of social cooperation that all see as normative." p20

There will still be disagreement. A “family” of liberal arrangements will justified, but there will be no uniquely publicly justified version.  "The question for contemporary public reason liberals is how one of the many equilibria is to be selected." p21
