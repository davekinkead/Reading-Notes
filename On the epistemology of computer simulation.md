# On the epistemology of computer simulation

> John von Neumann declared the end of the era of »analogy« and »representation« and the dawn of an era of »simulation« p30

> The German VDI-guideline 3633 states very simply: »Simulation is the imitation of a system and its dynamic processes in a model capable of experimental deployment in order to generate knowledge [...]. In particular, these processes are developed within a certain time frame.« p31

> In short, for my purposes, the term »simulation« means the totality of vari- ous practices and widespread forms of knowledge that have been emerging since 1945 through the new medium of computers

> Peter Galison stated that CS indicates a transformation in the understanding of computers in science from mere »tools« to »nature«.

> While appropriate programming structures provide virtual environments for »computer experiments«,8 CS establishes a »trading zone« between di erent scienti c disci- plines. These are no longer distinguished by their disparate »objects of inquiry« but coalesce through similar »strategies of practice«.
