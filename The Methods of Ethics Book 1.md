# The Methods of Ethics

## Book 1

### CH1

- What one _does_ is clearly distinction from what one _ought_ do.
- Ethics can be conceptualised as concerning proper conduct or proper ends.
- The primacy of either of these related concepts leads to incompatibility with each other.
- when asking 'why should I act this way', the answer will always depend on the perspective taken.

Ethics is the rational process of determining what individual's 'ought' do.  It is distinguished from politics by its focus on individual rather than collective behaviour, and from science by its normative rather than descriptive focus. p1

Sidgwick characterises ethics as the pursuit of what is right, as if this has some objective, ontological status just waiting to be discovered. p4

Hypothetical imperatives are not sufficient to explain the notion of 'ought', ie we ought value happiness makes no reference to some further end. p7

The choice of ultimate ends determines ethical system require to entail them. p8

Sidgwick identifies happiness (general hedonism/utilitarianism) along with excellence (deontology) as ultimate ends but provides little justification for their exclusive selection. p9

###CH2

Both politics and ethics seek to regulate behaviour.

"The happiness enjoyed in our actual society seems much diminished by the unequal distribution of the means of happiness, and the division of mankind into rich and poor." p21

###CH3

## Book 2 Egoistic Hedonism

Some observations:

- that maximising pleasure over pain as _a_ motivator for action seems self evident.  But why should it be the _ultimate_ end?
- if we accept that we all receive differing amounts P&P from the same activities, how can an observer interpret another's action?

### CH1

The term _Egoism_ can be equated with _Egoistic Hedonism_ and implies the ultimate end of each individual is the adoption of his own greatest happiness. p119

This premise is also a foundation of utilitarianism and intuitionalism.

Despite greatest personal happiness as the ultimate end, a man may aim for other goals that are instrumental in achieving them. p121

These goals may be determined empirically or deductively.

### CH2

The most fundamental assumption in the very conception of 'Greatest Happiness' is the commensurability of pleasures and pains - they bear a finite ratio to each other. p123

A neutral state of hedonistic zero is reached when pleasures balance pains.  In the normal, healthy course of our lives, we seems to be in a state of slight pleasure. p125

Pleasure and plain do not always correspond with motivation.  The urge to avoid tickling is greatly in excess of the stimulant. p127

Pleasure therefore is "a feeling which, when experienced by intelligent beings, is at least implicitly apprehended as desirable in cases of comparison - preferable." p127

Of course, egoistic hedonism simply assuming that pleasure is the ultimate end without justification. p129

Other key assumptions of hedonism are:p129

- pleasure and pain, estimated as feelings, have cognisable degrees of desirability and are definitely given in experience.
- we can by foresight and calculation increase these pleasures and pains, and these are within our control.

Yet, experience shows that the practice of hedonistic observation decreases our pleasures generally. p130

Assumption summary. Hedonism assumes:

- desirability of pleasurable feelings
- comparability of them
- predicability of them
- control of them

### CH3

Green's objection: if "pleasure as feeling, in distinction from its conditions that are not feelings, cannot be conceived." p132  But how can I conceive feeling to be inconceivable if I don't conceive of it?

Hedonism is self defeating.

"The pursuit of Egoistic Hedonism, when applied with a due knowledge of the laws of human nature, is practically self limiting." p136  Great happiness can often only be achieve once the pursuit of happiness is rejected.

"The man who embraces the principle of Rational Egoism cuts himself off from the special pleasure that attends this absolute sacrifice and abnegation of self." p138
