# Public goods, Private goods

### Raymond Geuss 2001

Benjamin Constant makes an early distinction between public & private spheres in 1814.  

The ancient democrats took an active role in citizenship, and there were no constraints over what they could decided collectively.  The moderns, with their representative democracy, required a private/public distinction to protect citizens from government overreach. p3 

Alexander Humboldt provides a contrast - that the highest human good is self-activity & self-development, and any action by the state promoting this is harmful as it preempts private action.  Thus, the state should be limits to security provision. p4

Geuss argues that the private/public distinction is ubiquitous in liberal theory and contemporary political discourse.  This distinction is evident by the differing evaluative standards that are used, the differing standards of justification, and differing methods and means ie use of coercion or force. p5

Geuss argues that there is no clear distinction but rather "a series of overlapping contrasts". p6  It is an "ideological concretion" and "theoretical ad hoc construction", motivating only through "tissues of delusion" p10.

## Shamelessness

On disgust: "Children do not need to be taught to withdraw their hands when they put them in a fire, but they notoriously _do_ need to be taught to have the proper reactions of disgust to their own excrement." p18

Disgust might be biologically rooted but it is also culturally malleable.  Compare giving poison and showing a picture of poison vs giving excrement and its image. p19  "Disgust renders its objects magically contagious" p20

A state of mutual dependence on others is the natural precondition of politics.  By striving for self-sufficiency, rejecting social convention, and erecting social barriers, the Cynics were deeply non-political. p28

In Athens, the concept of public was rooted in the idea of offending others and disattendability.  The _public_ is the realm where we don't do things that we are not shamed to do with those we are intimate with. p32

## Res Publica

Some etymology...

    public -> publicus "of the people; of the state; done for the state" -> pubes "of ripe years, grown up, full of sap"
    private -> privatus "set apart, belonging to oneself"

Public, from Roman linage, meant pertaining to those capable of fighting for the legion - the young men ripe for conquest.  _Public_ concerned the common good or the common interest. p37

There is considerable ambiguity as to whether _public_ means what is of common interest to all members of a group qua individuals, or what is of common good the the group qua group. p38 "Even if there is no common good, there may be matter of common concern" p41

Sometimes the vitality of individuals is necessary for the vitality of the group.  At other times, individual must suffer for the good of the group.

Public office originally concerned matters that were of common concern to all. p42
