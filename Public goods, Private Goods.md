# Public goods, Private goods

### Raymond Geuss 2001

Benjamin Constant makes an early distinction between public & private spheres in 1814.  

The ancient democrats took an active role in citizenship, and there were no constraints over what they could decided collectively.  The moderns, with their representative democracy, required a private/public distinction to protect citizens from government overreach. p3 

Alexander Humboldt provides a contrast - that the highest human good is self-activity & self-development, and any action by the state promoting this is harmful as it preempts private action.  Thus, the state should be limits to security provision. p4

Geuss argues that the private/public distinction is ubiquitous in liberal theory and contemporary political discourse.  This distinction is evident by the differing evaluative standards that are used, the differing standards of justification, and differing methods and means ie use of coercion or force. p5

Geuss argues that there is no clear distinction but rather "a series of overlapping contrasts". p6  It is an "ideological concretion" and "theoretical ad hoc construction", motivating only through "tissues of delusion" p10.

## Shamelessness

On disgust: "Children do not need to be taught to withdraw their hands when they put them in a fire, but they notoriously _do_ need to be taught to have the proper reactions of disgust to their own excrement." p18

Disgust might be biologically rooted but it is also culturally malleable.  Compare giving poison and showing a picture of poison vs giving excrement and its image. p19  "Disgust renders its objects magically contagious" p20

A state of mutual dependence on others is the natural precondition of politics.  By striving for self-sufficiency, rejecting social convention, and erecting social barriers, the Cynics were deeply non-political. p28

In Athens, the concept of public was rooted in the idea of offending others and disattendability.  The _public_ is the realm where we don't do things that we are not shamed to do with those we are intimate with. p32

## Res Publica

Some etymology...

    public -> publicus "of the people; of the state; done for the state" -> pubes "of ripe years, grown up, full of sap"
    private -> privatus "set apart, belonging to oneself"

Public, from Roman linage, meant pertaining to those capable of fighting for the legion - the young men ripe for conquest.  _Public_ concerned the common good or the common interest. p37

There is considerable ambiguity as to whether _public_ means what is of common interest to all members of a group qua individuals, or what is of common good the the group qua group. p38 "Even if there is no common good, there may be matter of common concern" p41

Sometimes the vitality of individuals is necessary for the vitality of the group.  At other times, individual must suffer for the good of the group.

Public office originally concerned matters that were of common concern to all. p42

The common good is any external state of affairs that members of some group would do well to bring about. p46

If you live in a political state that is in competition with others, then the preservation and flourishing of the state might give rise to independent reasons for action, transforming the notion of common good from good for all to good for the state. p48

It is a substantive claim, not a tautology, that everyone affected by certain decision should have 1) cognitive access to them, 2) control over the agencies that make them, and 3) be decided on by everyone. p53-54

## Epistemic & Ontological Privilege

Another way of conceptualising the public-private distinction is through epistemic and ontological privilege.  The private is what ever is accessible of knowable only by an agent. Mental states are inherently private, while certain information is contingently private if it is not known by others. p71

Somethings _should be_ private because they offend others, others _are_ private due to ontological or epistemic privilege, while others still _benefit_ individuals and groups differently - and are therefore of private or public interest. p74

## Liberalism

Liberalism is concerned with the public/private distinction because it is interested in defending the private sphere from public encroachment. Yet these conceptions of public and private do not map squarely with the others. p76

_What ought not be interfered with_ is not the same as _what ought not interfere_. p77

The public/private distinction and conception of public good or interest is itself a private belief.  Is it even possible to not act on a private belief concerning the public good? p79

"So the question of what is _private_ for liberalism is the question of what sorts of things, that is, what kinds of goods, it is desirable or advisable to protect from what kinds of social and governmental interferences for what reasons and in what whats" p80  This leads to 4 questions:

1. How extensive a sphere of _private_ should be protected from the _public_?
2. What is meant by the _public_? Government, social institutions, public opinion, or other individuals?
3. For what reasons is it advisable to defend the _private_ from the _public_?
4. How should this defence be enforced?

Mill argues that affect is the criterion for demarcating the two, but affect is hopelessly vague. What is epistemically or ontologically private doesn't need protecting. p81  But who does the evaluating? p83

Dewey's conception of the demarcation is relative to social knowledge, what we count as consequences, value judgements of society, and who is directly concerned by them.

Liberalism typically seeks to determine what is public & private followed by what our attitudes to them should be.  And equally valid approach is to ask given these values, what should we deem public & private, and worthy of protecting. p86

Privacy is related to the _private_. It might be worth protecting because we value secrecy and information asymmetry; some interactions are delicate and can be disturbed by the presence or knowledge of others; we may value from experimentation but knowledge of or actual failures can be harmful; p88-90 or we may simply value aloneness.

The private may be worth protecting if we feel that it is the only way to realise substantive ideals like self-development and autonomy. We also may not be able to judge which substantive ideals are worth pursuing so must protect many paths. p92

The public might be better defined as 'living in a variety of overlapping publics' p93.  The whole idea of a common good is predicated on the idea that there is something that is shared by all.  But what if there are no 'systematic consequences to be cared for'? "If there is no public good, then, _a fortiori_, there cannot be a nondeceptive shared public conception of the (public) good in such a society." p95

Geuss argues that any public or common good requires the equalisation of resources between those persons and groups currently rich and those currently poor, in order for them to have shared interests and consequences. p100

"We are stuck with various conceptions of goods, some public, some private, with no clear principles for structuring them under a single conception of unitary public good." p104
