> We use the term cyberphilosophy broadly to designate the intersection of philosophy and computing. (p4)

> Cyberphilosophy came into its own during the twentieth century as a result of the formulation of the theory of computing by Alan Turing and others, by analysis of social and ethical implications of computing by Norbert Wiener, and by the development of increasingly sophisticated computers, software, and networks. (p4)

> All major areas of philosophy - episte mology, metaphysics, and value theory - have been influenced by comput ing (p4)

> our overall thesis in The Digital Phoenix was that computing provides philosophy with new and fertile subject matter, models, and methods. (p5)

> Because computational processes are so logically malleable, they provide intellectual clay that can be shaped to formulate ideas, explain events, and test hypotheses. (p5)

> Such models provide computer-assisted thought experi ments, the results of which might well be unknown and unappreciated without computer (p5)

> Philosophy done with computers has an empirical dimension that distin guishes it from philosophy typically thought of as pure conceptual analysis or synthetic construction (p6)
