### Could Arbitrary Imitation and Pattern Completion Have Bootstrapped Human Linguistic Communication?

> The present study explores the idea that human linguistic communication co- opted a pre-existing population-wide behavioural system that was shared among social group members and whose structure reflected the structure of the environment. This system is hypothesized to have emerged from interactions among individuals who had evolved the capacity to imitate arbitrary, functionless behaviour. A series of agent-based computer simulations test the separate and joint effects of imitation, pattern completion behaviour, environment structure and level of social interaction on such a population-wide behavioural system. The results support the view that a system that could be co-opted for linguistic communication might arise in a population of agents equipped with arbitrary imitation for the purposes of pattern completion interacting in certain kinds of structured environments. Such pre-linguistic behavioural system could have bootstrapped communication and paved the way for biological capacities widely believed to be necessary for communication, such as shared intentionality and symbolicity, to evolve.

Uses agent based modelling to verify a linguist bootstrap thesis

> The objective of the present study was to explore the effect of a hypothesized capacity for function-independent or arbitrary imitation for pattern completion on the emergence of a behavioural system with the potential to bootstrap linguistic communication. (p30)

Compares itself to earlier simulations except that this drops many requirements

> Unlike most of those simulations, the present model does not involve shared goals, explicit symbolicity or intentional communication, and therefore it does not include mechanisms that help form conventional, shared mappings between objects and behaviours, such as the corrective feedback or knowledge transfer (p11)

Involves a description of the simulation model followed by a discussion of the results.

> The pivotal biological adaptation necessary for the emergence of coordinated, systematic mappings in a population is arbitrary imitation. (p31)
