# What sort of political equality does deliberative democracy require?

## Knight & Johson 1997

Democracy means rule of the people where the people are characterised by divergent material interests, cultural attachments, and ethical commitments. p279

Democracy must be "open to participation and where, from the perspectives of participants, outcomes are not known ex ante." 

These interests mustn't be privileged one way or the other.  No single group should be able to dictate outcomes unilaterally.

"If democracy requires equality, an obvious serious question remains: What sort of equality does it require." p280

"Most defences of democratic deliberation insist that this criterion of legitimacy requires a strong form of equality."

Democracy requires some version of equality of opportunity!

Influence can be though of as the ability to lead others to vote as one wants. p281 -- INVESTIGATE Dworkin 1987 p9

Equal access to deliberative arenas is necessary (but not sufficient for democratic legitimacy) p282

Arrow impossibility thesis requires procedural equality. p283

  - unrestricted domain
  - anonymity
  - neutrality

Substantive equality requires that ones interests and goals are accounted for in the democratic processes. p292

"Procedural mechanisms alone will not guarantee this feature."

Citing Cohen 1989 p33

> participants are substantively equal in that the existing distributions of power and resources does not shape their chances to contribute at any stage of the deliberative process, nor does that distribution play an authoritative role in their deliberations.

Equal opportunity of political influence requires that asymmetries in the distribution of power don't affect deliberation. p293

This requires us to "determine which factors are political relevant...[and which] warrant corrective measures to address inequality"

> Given the uncertainty in the democratic process, equal opportunity of influence should not entail equality of outcome, at least insofar as equality of outcome might mean that all relevant interests are equally manifest in collective outcomes. p295

> We cannot deduce what is politically fair from abstract principles of political equality: we have to draw on empirical judgement of what is likely to happen as well as what seems in principle to be fair. -- Phillips 1995 p38

"The greater the deviation between an individual's preference and those of the collectivity, the lesser the presumed causal effect" p301

> Most people would agree that the dictates of political equality are violated in those cases in which the interests of a particular social group are never reflected in the collective outcomes. p302
