# Paradoxes of Constitutional Democracy

The typical myth of democratic formation is a story where a "democratic constitution is both an act whereby a nation is founded and a legal document resulting form that act" p330

"It is subject to an inherent bootstrapping problem: democracy is both a necessary feature of such a project and its intended result." p330

"Democratic citizens cannont create the same procedures that are required to institutionalize democracy itself" p330

"Legitimate procedures structuring democracy cannot, in short, be _prerequisites_ for legitimate procedures structuring democracy" p330

## Paradox of Founding

The paradox of constitutional democracy arises from the conjunction of democracy and law. p331
See Frank Michelman 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999

"legal and political order cannot be democratically founded,at least not in a procedurally legitimate sense." p331

"any democratic attempt to establish a constitution requires a previous constution that has already established democratic procedures" p331

This conception is regressive - moving to some end point requires a first step but each first step requires an earlier one.

"A first step in founding a constitution is impossible because it cannotbe legitimately accomplished" p331

## Dynamic Constitutionalism

By bracketing off the requirement that each law must be established by some prior legitimatel norm, we can approach our end state incrementally from an illegitimate start. p332
See Habermas 1996

Yet this is exclusionary - excludes certain groups from participation and opportunites.  A different conception of legitimacy is therefore needed - a forward, rather than backward looking one.

"judgments of legitimacy need to evaluate the constitution's current ability to produce conditions allowing full political inclusion at some point in the future." p332

"judgments of legitimacy need to eval- uate the constitution's current ability to produce conditions allowing full political inclusion at some point in the future." p332

## The Paradox of Dynamic Indeterminism

In order to judge dynamic constitutionalism, we need some future directed end point to which the current, initially illegitimate, structure can be judged.

But a legitimate end point implies maximal 'democracy', legitimacy or equality or some such.  This would then restrict the dynamic and evolving nature of the dynamic entity.

Thus no dynamic entity can ever be legitimate if legitimacy requires reaching some static end point.

Alternatively, "As a result,such citizens would be in the paradoxical position of applying a conception of legitimacy that is premised on making predictions about the future to a political system that by definition frustrate such" p334 "it is endmic to political conceptions of democracy that combine a future orientated legitimacy with a dynamic, evolving constitution".

"Both paradoxes have a common source - they are internal to the project of democratically self-generating legitimacy" p334

## Constitutional Patriotism

Habermas account sees normative strength in communication and deliberation. Anyone affected by some proposal is offered the oportunity to debate it. Yet it presupposes a commitment to equality, full inclusion, desire for shared political culture and the absense of preemptive self-interest.

## Reflexive Agency

Laws give people poltical agency. They define their political rights and opportunities. p337

This agency is relfexive as it allows them to redefine the laws that define their agency.

"The greater a citizen's reflexivity, the more control she has over the legal measures that specify her own agency." p338

Olsen's solution is path-dependent political agency. If the path towards full inclusion is propabilistically likely, then the path is legitimate. 

## Critique

If probable path dependence towards full inclusion & agency is the criterium of legitimacy to avoid the paradox, then why not just impose that full inclusion from the outset?
How is this saying that democracy is anything more than full and equal political agency??
