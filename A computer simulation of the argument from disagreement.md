> In this paper we shed new light on the Argument from Disagreement by putting it to test in a computer simulation. According to this argument widespread and persistent disagreement on ethical issues indicates that our moral opinions are not influenced by any moral facts, either because no such facts exist or because they are epistemically inaccessible or inefficacious for some other reason. Our simulation shows that if our moral opinions were influenced at least a little bit by moral facts, we would quickly have reached consensus, even if our moral opinions were affected by factors such as false authorities, external political shifts, and random processes. Therefore, since no such consensus has been reached, the simulation gives us increased reason to take seriously the Argument from Disagreement. Our conclusion is however not conclusive; the simulation also indicates what assumptions one has to make in order to reject the Argument from Disagreement. The simulation algorithm we use builds on the work of Hegselmann and Krause (J Artif Soc Social Simul 5(3); 2002, J Artif Soc Social Simul 9(3), 2006).

Uses simulation to refute criticism of the Argument from Disagreement under certain conditions.

Importantly, it models a moral theory to show under what conditions it holds, then relates those conditions to the real world.


They cite Mackie (1977) & Shafer-Landau(2003) and Tersman(2006,p.xii). as examples of epistemic weakness in traditional arguments ...

> The first is exemplified in Mackie’s treatment: He offers no or little support for the claim that variations in moral opinions are more readily explained by the non-realist hypothesis than its realist rival. (388)

> So how can claims about disagreement disprove the existence or epistemic inefficacy of moral facts, given that we agree on many—or even most—moral issues?

The model is described in the paper but no source code is provided or linked.

> We shall model this by adopting a generalized version of a model originally developed by Hegselmann and Krause. (p390)

The simulation is used to generate data and then statistical analysis is performed.  The results are presented in tabular and graph form.
