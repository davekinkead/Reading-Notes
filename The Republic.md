# The Republic

### By Plato

### Translated by Benjamin Jowett (1873)

## Book I

Socrates discusses some conceptions of justice with his companions.  Cephalus suggests that justice is telling the truth and paying one's debts, but Socrates argues that you wouldn't tell the truth or return a borrowed weapon to a mad man. Polemarchus extends this into justice is paying one's dues, but Socrates claims that it is never just to harm an enemy.

Thrasymachus argues that justice is simply what is in the interest of the stronger party [338b].  Socrates dismisses these arguments - often in a way described as "embarrassingly bad" by Cross & Woozley - via analogy to skill and employment.  Rules can often be wrong so justice requires obeying their commands even when it is not in their interest.


## Book II

Socrates investigates justice in society.  He argues that society is formed to solve two basics demands - mutal need among men who are not self sufficient [369b], and difference of aptitude and mutual trade [370a].  From this, he argues that the most basic society would have 5 economic classes - producers, merchants, sailors, retailers, and labourers

Increased wealth derived from specialisation leads to increased resource demand and conflict with neighbours over productive territory [373d].  Soldiers are therefore required and specialisation demands that they are their own class [374b].  These 'guardians' will need high spirits, speed, strength, and a philosophical disposition [376c].


## Book IV

After educating the Guardians, some must be selected to rule. Socrates argues that only those best suited to govern, and those who love the community most, should rule [412d].  They should be tested for purity in these virtues and those worthy given authority in the state [414a].  Non-ruling guardians by constrast are the Auxiliaries - those who help the Guardians rule.

To prevent the superior strength and abilities of the Guardians from degenerating into tyranny.  Thus they should be well educated but prevented from owning private property or possessing wealth [416d].  The community should provide suitable food and shelter for them sufficient for their military needs.

The purpose of founding a state is to promote the happiness of the whole community, not just one class [420b].  Wealth and poverty are the two things that can corrupt a city so the Guardians must ensure these don't materialise.  The state must be allowed to grow while it's size is compatible with unity but no further [423b].  The meritocracy must be maintain and education enforced.

The perfect state has the qualities of wisdom, courage, self-discipline, and justice.  These are provided by the wisdom of the wisest Guardians [428], courage from the Auxiliaries [430a], self-discipline from the acceptance of the class structure [432a], and justice from the excellence of each class minding their own business and doing what they do best [434c].  This makes the perfect state just.

Like the state, the balance of individual virtues make one just or injust.  Reason and spirit in harmony lead to discipline, and excellence leads to justice. "justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul" [444d].

This perfect constitution of a state is called Monarchy if ruled by a single person and Aristocracy is ruled by a number [445d].  This is the first of five political forms with the others being bad or defective.


## Book V

The perfect state Socrates has describes is an ideal one.  He is pressed to explain how it can be realised and responds that it cannot until philosophers become kings and kings become philosophers [473d].


## Book VIII

"in the perfect State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?" [543a]

"the four governments of which I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst disorder of a State. [544c]"

Timocracy or timarchy - Socrates knows no name for it - is an ambitious society like Sparta [545b].  When greed infects the virtuous Guardian rulers, the Guardians demand property and wealth and make the others in society their serfs [547c].  It will still have respect for authority and the Guardians will still abstain from production, but they will reject the need for intelligence, and prefer war to peace [547e].  The timarchic character is ambitious, energetic, and athletic but has an inner uncertainly and conflict.

The accumulation of wealth in the ruling class destroys timocracy [550b].  Wealth & power coincide so the rulers legislate for their own wealth and limit power to those with it [551b].  The meritocratic nature of the aristocracy is eroded and two classes - rich and poor - are created [511d].  The state can no longer wage war or defend itself because the oligarchs can't fight themselves and fear arming the poor [551d].  The poor become consumer drones or criminals [552c].  The oligarchic character cares only for money - ambition becomes avarice. 

Inequality and the excesses of the oligarchs lead to an uprising of the capable poor.  

"democracy, I suppose, comes into being when the poor, winning the victory, put to death some of the other party, drive out others, and grant the rest of the citizens an equal share in both citizenship and offices and for the most part these offices are assigned by lot....it's done by force of arms or by frightening opponents into withdraw" [557a]

Democracy involves equality and freedom.  This freedom results in a beautiful diversity that makes it very appealing [557c].  Socrates proceeds to describe democracy as anarchy - where anyone is free to flout the constitution. 

The excessive desire for liberty at the expense of everything else results in tyranny [562c].  The climax of popular liberty occurs when slaves are equal to slave owners, and men are equal to women [563b].  People rebel against any constraints and a violent reaction occurs. 

Tyranny is the result of democracy, and slavery the result of extreme freedom [564a].  Savvy politicians manipulate the people with appeals to self-interest.  They aquier body guards, then private armies, disarm the people, then seize absolute power.
