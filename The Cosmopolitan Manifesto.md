The Cosmopolitan Manifesto
==========================

**Ulrich Beck 2011**

Beck contrasts the First Modernity, society characterised by the nation-state & understood territorially, with the Second Modernity, the first undermined by globalisation, individualisation, gender revolution, underemployment, and global risks. p2 

Reflexive modernisation is the radical change of modernity that undermines its frame of reference. p2

"Risk is an (institutionalized) attempt, a cognitive map, to colonise the future" p3. **Bollocks!**

"The democratisation of democracy". p5 What the fuck is that supposed to mean?????

While risk is increasing everywhere, the distribution of risk is being disproportionately borne by the world's poor. p5

"Free market ideology has increased the sum of human misery". p6

The globalised market is a new form of organised irresponsibility because it disconnects the tradition linkages between risk and responsibility p6.

"Because there is no global government, the global market risk cannot be regulated like national markets.  Nor can any national market resist it with impunity" p7.

Referencing the 1997 Asian crisis: "The global free market is falling apart and the global free market ideology is collapsing" p8.

This age is marked by an increasing individualisation; not an atomisation but flourishing of autonomy.  individualisation thus paradoxically implies a collective lifestyle. p9

There is inherent conflict between terrestrially fixed political forces (the state) and non-terrestrial forces (capital, trade).  Capital is global, work is local. p11

"We need a basic assurance income as a sine qua non of a political republic of individuals who create a sense of cohesion and fellow feeling through public conflict and commitment" p13

Is he conflating cosmopolitanism for paternalistic imperialism? p13-14

"The central human worries are world problems" p15

Beck asks a very good question: "Should risks and their attendant costs be shared among certain categories of people or among residents of certain places?" p16


Questions:

- Are characterisations of modern change as disruptive and undermining any different than the changes that the enlightenment brought?  Wasn't it disruptive and undermining of the status quo?
- Is this just a question of perspective of change before the new paradigm/equilibria is reached?
