Who Should Vote? Conceptualizing Universal Suffrage in Studies of Democracy
================================


Universal suffrage is not universal 

- "There has never been and is unlikely to ever be an election to the government where all members of a society are in possession of the legal right to vote" p30

Argues for the separation of descriptive and normative measures of democracy and outlines 3 methodological approaches:

- Minimalist - "the conceptual concept of the term is stated economically; enumerating as few properties of the referent as possible" p34.  See Gurr, Przeworski.  Its primary flaw is that it includes too much - all democratic countries are fully democratic

- Conventionalist - "identifies the conceptual content of inclusion with the criteria at work in the laws and constitutions of advanced democracies" p36  This approach fails to offer normative comparisons

- Maximalist - a conception that includes great intention and more phenomena p38.  

Differing needs of descriptive and normative analysis require different tools.

- "we should not ignore the possibility of some restrictions being justified even if their imposition would make the political system less democratic" p42

The descriptive analysis shouldn't make normative claims.

Highlights the issue of symmetry between the ruled and the rulers when analysing suffrage.
