The Concepts of Obligation and Duty
===================================


Oblige derives from *ob* + *ligare* - 'to bind'. p386

Duty stems from due - paid as a mark of submission to a lord. p387

Brandt contrasts paradigmatic and extended uses of the terms.  Paradigmatic uses are relatively consistent - given the same context, more people would choose the same word. They also hold certain features in common and the term has come to suggest those features. p385

Obligation and duty, in the paradigmatic sense, can be contrasted as thus:

"Obligation functions in agreement-relations and retributive-relations, where duty does not, and duty functions in pure organisation-role relations where obligation does not"  p392

Obligations have in common: p387

-	two parties are involved
- 	a roughly specifiable service is required of one person
-	a prior transaction is the source of the relationship

Duties have in common: p388

-	an individual occupies some position in an organisation
-	the position is deemed of some value to the organisation
-	the job is associated with the office occupied by the individual
-	performance is expected and required
