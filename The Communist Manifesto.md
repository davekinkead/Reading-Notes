# The Communist Manifesto 

Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels (1848)
1888 English Edition

## I. Bourgeois and Proletarians

_Bourgeoisie_: The class of modern Capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage-labor. 

_Proletariat_: The class of modern wage-laborers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor-power in order to live.

Societies have always been organised into classes.  "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."  During modern times, the multitude of social classes have evolved into 2 - those who control capital and those who sell their labour.  

This evolution is a historical process.  As the economic power of the bourgeoisie grew, so too did their political power until today, the representative state "is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie."

Their rise was revolutionary. They transformed all previous relations into relations of exchange.  While previous dominant classes relied on the conservation of modes of productions, the bourgeoisie rely on constant revolution.  And it compels all those it competes against to adopt its tactics, "it creates a world after its own image". 

Capitalism is a powerful centralising force.  It concentrates economic and political power, drawing resources from the peripheries to the centre, and giving humankind control over nature and each other.  

The foundations of the bourgeoisie were laid in the previous era of feudalism but the forces that developed from them usurped feudal relations.  The same productive forces that drive capitalism are threaten to destroy it.  Capitalism creates over production which requires either destruction of productivity or expansion into new markets in order to survive.

But the rise of the bourgeoisie also created the proletariate. The proletariate grows in proportion to the growth of capital.  Its labour is a commodity like any other in the capitalist economy but the capitalist forces strip it of any character and charm.

The price of labour is its cost of production - human substance.  Mechanisation and division of labour force the demand for labour downward making the proletariate the slave to the bourgeoisie.  Competition swells the ranks of the proletariate as the middle class of merchants and self-employed are driven out of business and must sell their labour instead.

Initially, the proletariate fight the instruments of production rather than the conditions of production.  They fails to properly organise.  The bourgeoisie succeeds in directing their anger not against their bourgeoisie enemy but the petitie bourgeoisie - the aristocracy and land owners.

But capitalism gives the proletariate both its motivation and means of organising.  Increased mechanisation drives down wages, making workers equally miserable; while also providing the communication technology needed to unite.  Workers form unions, and unions form political parties. Every class struggle is a political struggle. 

Competition creates conflict.  Each group seeks to maintain and increase its own power.  The petite bourgeoisie and lower middle class are reactionary - they seeks to maintain what they have or had.  But those who have nothing have nothing to maintain.  Those who obtain the upper hand seek to subjugate other to maintain their position.  But the proletariate cannot because it owns nothing.

"[E]very form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes"  

"The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labor. Wage-labor rests exclusively on competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."
