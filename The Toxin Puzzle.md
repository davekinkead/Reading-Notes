# The Toxin Puzzle

#### Gregory Kavka, 1983

Outlines a puzzle to show that one can't freely intend to intend.

- An eccentric billionaire offers you $1,000,000 if you take an unpleasant but non-lethal toxin.
- You'll receive the money at midnight only if you actually intend at midnight to drink the toxin at 10am the following day.
- But even if you do intend to drink, by 10am the money has already been paid, so you wont drink.
- You know this so you can't intend to drink at midnight.
- You aren't allowed to bind yourself to any third parties.

"You are asked to form a simple intention to perform an act that is well within your power. This is the kind of thing we all do many times
every day. You are provided with an overwhelming incentive for doing so. Yet you cannot do so (or have extreme difficulty doing
so) without resorting to exotic tricks involving hypnosis, hired killers, etc. Nor are your difficulties traceable to an uncontrollable
fear of the negative consequences of the act in question - you would be perfectly willing to undergo the after-effects of the toxin
to earn the million." p35

"intentions are better viewed as dispositions to act which are based on reasons to act - features of the act itself" p35

"It also reveals that intentions are only partly volitional. One cannot intend whatever one wants to intend any more than one can believe whatever one wants to believe. As our beliefs are constrained by our evidence, so our intentions are constrained by our reasons
for action." p36
