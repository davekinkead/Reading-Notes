# Condorcet's Jury Theorem and the Optimum Number of Voters

### Jason Brennan 2011

A definition of CJT:

> on a dichotomous choice, individuals who all have the same level of competence (or probability of being correct) above 0.5, can make collective decisions under majority rule with a competence that approaches 1 (infallibility) as either the size of the group or individual competence goes up’ (Estlund, 1994, p. 131). -- p55

"Many people use Condorcet’s Jury Theorem to defend democracy on instrumental grounds (e.g. Barry, 1965; Dagger, 1997, pp. 96–97; Goodin, 2003; Grofman and Feld, 1988; List and Goodin, 2001)" p55

"According to Condorcet’s Jury Theorem, the probability (PN) that an electorate of size N will make a correct decision is given by equation 1 (Estlund, 1994, p. 136; Goodin and Estlund, 2004, p. 142; Mueller, 2003, p. 129):2"

    N N! i N−i
    PN =∑(N−i)!i!(pc)(1−pc) (1)
    i=m

"When voting has no opportunity cost, the expected marginal value (EV) of the Nth voter’s vote is given by equation 3:" (p57)

    EV = ΔPn (VC −VW)

"If voting had no opportunity cost, the optimal number of voters would be infinite." p57

    EV =ΔPN(VC −VW)−Co

" On the Condorcetian model, the optimal number of voters is a function of three variables: (a) the opportunity cost of voting; (b) the difference in expected value between the better and worse electoral results; and (c) the competence of the voters." p58

"One clear way to show that on the Condorcetian model, mass voting is wasteful, is to calculate the optimal number of voters using unrealistic numbers, numbers purposefully chosen to inflate the optimal number of voters." p58

"If Condorcet’s Jury Theorem adequately models democracy, this provides compel- ling reasons to favour democracy over other regime types. However, at the same time, it provides strong reasons against mass participation. " p59

"On Condorcet’s Jury Theorem, group competence is a function of average individual competence." p61

"all the measurable good of democracy is secured with only a small number of voters." p61
