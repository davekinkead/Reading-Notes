# The Fixation of Belief

### II

"The object of reasoning is to find out, from the consideration of what we already know, something else which we do not know"

Validity is one consideration.

"It is true that we do generally reason correctly by nature. But that is an accident; the true conclusion would remain true if we had no impulse to accept it; and the false one would remain false, though we could not resist the tendency to believe in it."

In evolutionary terms, it might be more advatnagous for us to reason over optimistically.

### III

"Doubt is an uneasy and dissatisfied state from which we struggle to free ourselves and pass into the state of belief;"

### IV

"we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and, indeed, it is mere tautology to say so."

Without the struggle of belief, there is no doubt, and without doubt, there is no inquiry.

"If the premisses are not in fact doubted at all, they cannot be more satisfactory than they are."

### V

"Unless we make ourselves hermits, we shall necessarily influence each otherâ€™s opinions; so that the problem becomes how to fix belief, not in the individual merely, but in the community."
