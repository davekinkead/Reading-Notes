# Political Communication in Media Society - Does Democracy Still Enjoy an Epistemic Dimension

Thesis: Deliberative Democracy requires the independence of a self-regulated media system and the right kind of feedback between mediated political communication and civil society. 

> I first compare the deliberative to the liberal and the republican models of democracy, and consider possible references to empirical research and then examine what empirical evidence there is for the assumption that political deliberation develops a truth-tracking potential. The main parts of the paper serve to dispel prima facie doubts about the empirical content and the applicability of the communication model of deliberative politics. It moreover highlights 2 critical conditions: mediated political communication in the public sphere can facilitate deliberative legitimation processes in complex societies only if a self-regulating media system gains independence from its social environments and if anonymous audiences grant a feedback between an informed elite discourse and a responsive civil society.

Institutional design of modern democracies brings together three elements:

  1. the private autonomy of citizens
  2. democratic citizenship
  3. the independence of a public sphere

Difference conceptions of democracy (liberal, republican, deliberative) prioritise different elements.

> The deliberative model is interested more in the epistemic function of discourse and negotiation than in rational choice or political ethos. p413

> The deliberative paradigm offers as its main empirical point of reference a democratic process, which is supposed to generate legitimacy through a procedure of opinion and will formation that grants (a) publicity and transparency for the delib- erative process, (b) inclusion and equal opportunity for participation, and (c) a justi- fied presumption for reasonable outcomes (mainly in view of the impact of arguments on rational changes in preference) (Bohman, 1996; Bohman & Rehg, 1997).

> The presumption of reasonable outcomes rests in turn on the assumption that institutionalized discourses mobilize relevant topics and claims, promote the critical evaluation of contributions, and lead to rationally motivated yes or no reactions. p413

There is strong empiric evidence to accept the claim that deliberation leads to positive epistemic outcomes.

> The process of group deliberation resulted in a unidirectional change and not in a polarization of opinions. (see Neblo 2005)

> Druckman (2004) writes, ‘‘individuals who engage in conversations with a heterogeneous group will be less susceptible to framing effects than those who do not engage in conversations’’ (p. 675). p414

But ...

>  the dynamics of mass communication are driven by the power of the media to select, and shape the presentation of, messages and by the strategic use of political and social power to influence the agendas as well as the triggering and framing of public issues. p415


> Public opinions make manifest what large but conflicting sectors of the population consider in the light of available information to be the most plausible interpretations of each of the controversial issues at hand. p418

Media professional have _media power_ but ...

> From the viewpoint of democratic legitimacy, media power nevertheless remains ‘‘innocent’’ to the extent that journalists operate within a functionally specific and self-regulating media system. p419

> even governments usually have no control over how the media then present and interpret their messages, over how political elites or wider publics receive them, or over how they respond to them (Jarren & Donges).  p419

> This power is constrained, however, by the peculiar reflexivity of a public sphere that allows all participants to reconsider what they perceive as public opinion. 

>  However, the unequal distribution of the means for such interventions does not necessarily distort the formation of considered public opinions. p419

> ... even the powerful actors will only contribute to the mobilization of relevant issues, facts, and arguments.... [only if] ... a self-regulating media system must maintain its independence vis-a-vis its environments while linking political communication in the public sphere with both civil society and the political center; second, an inclusive civil society must empower citizens to parti- cipate in and respond to a public discourse that, in turn, must not degenerate into a colonizing mode of communication. p420

> [voters] can build ... [reasonable attitutes to public affairs] by aggregating their often tacit and since forgotten reactions to casually received bits and pieces of information, which they had initially integrated into and evaluated against the background of evolving conceptual schemes. p420

> [Deliberative Democracy requires[] .. the independence of a self-regulated media system and the right kind of feedback between mediated political communication and civil society. p420

Iraq war coverage as an example of failure of media independence:

> One consequence of this incomplete differentiation of mediated communication from the core of the political system was that public broadcasting indulged in a kind of paternalism, as if immature citizens needed due political instruction from on high (Padovani, 2005). p421

> [Private media owners] ... can use their economic clout as a switch to immediately convert media power into public influence and political pressure. p421

Side note on epistemic virtues & habits ...

> Deliberation is a demanding form of communication, though it grows out of incon- spicuous daily routines of asking for and giving reasons. p413


Quotable Quotes

> Ideas enter into social reality via the idealizing presuppositions innate in every- day practices and inconspicuously acquire the quality of stubborn social facts. p413

> Imagine the public sphere as an intermediary system of communication between formally organized and informal face-to-face deliberations in arenas at both the top and the bottom of the political system. p415
